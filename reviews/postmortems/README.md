# PR Postmortems

Purpose
- Each PR must add a filled postmortem entry based on `PR_POSTMORTEM_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Entries are structured for parsing and enforcement.

Naming
- Use `YYYY-MM-DD_<short-description>.md`.

Rules
- Every PR must include at least one entry file in this folder.
- Entries must follow `PR_POSTMORTEM_TEMPLATE.md` and include all required sections.
- If a recurring issue is identified in the postmortem, update `WORKFLOW_FRICTION.md` with the next elevation action.

Historical note
- Older entries may reference legacy Ralph/workflow-acceptance files.
- Treat those references as archival context, not current workflow contract.
