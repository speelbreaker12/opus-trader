# Source of Truth Policy (SSOT)

## Objective
Eliminate spec drift by making authority resolution mechanical, not interpretive.

## Authority Tiers
### Tier 0 - Normative (MUST FOLLOW)
Only files under `/specs/` are normative.

Canonical entry points:
- specs/CONTRACT.md
- specs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- specs/POLICY.md
- specs/WORKFLOW_CONTRACT.md

### Tier 1 - Derived / Explanatory (NON-NORMATIVE)
The following are derived, explanatory, or workflow aids and MUST NOT be treated as requirements:
- /docs/**
- /reviews/**
- /prompts/**
- /SKILLS/**
- /artifacts/**
- /to-do/**
- repo-root README.md, WORKFLOW_FRICTION.md

If a Tier 1 document conflicts with Tier 0, Tier 1 is wrong.

## Redirect Stubs
Root-level files named CONTRACT.md / IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md / POLICY.md are allowed ONLY as redirect stubs.
A redirect stub MUST:
- contain the line "CANONICAL SOURCE OF TRUTH:"
- point to the matching `/specs/...` file
- contain no requirements, registries, thresholds, or acceptance tests

## Duplication Policy
Duplicate normative filenames are forbidden outside `/specs/`, except redirect stubs as defined above.

Examples of forbidden duplicates outside `/specs/`:
- CONTRACT.md (non-stub)
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (non-stub)
- POLICY.md (non-stub)
- GLOBAL_INVARIANTS.md
- ARCH_FLOWS.yaml
- TIME_FRESHNESS.yaml
- VQ_EVIDENCE.md
- state machine YAMLs

## Change Control
Any change to Tier 0 files MUST be accompanied by:
- updated acceptance tests / references (where applicable)
- updated derived artifacts (if generated by the workflow)

## Generated Artifacts
Artifacts under /artifacts/** may be committed only if explicitly required by workflow acceptance.
Otherwise they should be treated as build outputs.
