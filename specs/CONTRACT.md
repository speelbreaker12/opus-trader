## Patch Summary (P0 — TradingMode Canonicalization)

This Patch Summary is non-normative; see §0.0 for normative scope.

**Applied:** 2026-01-15  
**Objective:** Eliminate TradingMode split-brain; canonicalize under PolicyGuard ownership.

- **§2.2.3 Axis Resolver v2** — Replaces the legacy ladder with a 3-axis resolver; deterministic TradingMode + tier-pure reason codes; Kill semantics are capital-supremacy-safe (containment permitted while exposed).
- **§2.2.3 ModeReasonCode Registry** — Added authoritative reason codes exposed via `/api/v1/status` (prevents "operator lies").
- **§2.2.4 Open Permission Latch (CP-001)** — Blocks opens after restart/WS gaps/session kill until reconciliation clears (5 reconcile-class codes).
- **§2.2 PolicyGuard Inputs** — Extended input list to explicitly include all fields referenced by the axis resolver (see §2.2).
- **§2.2.2 EvidenceGuard Queue Depth Gate** — Added `parquet_queue_depth_pct <= 0.90` fail-closed gate with hysteresis.
- **§7.0 /status Observability** — Added 4 required fields: `mode_reasons`, `open_permission_blocked_latch`, `open_permission_reason_codes`, `open_permission_requires_reconcile`.
- **§7.2 Decision Snapshot Retention** — Explicit defaults (30d, ≥2d bound) aligned with Replay Gatekeeper 48h window.
- **§1.4.3, §3.3 Wording Cleanup** — "PolicyGuard MUST force" (not "Force TradingMode"); fixed §3.3 10028 Kill contradiction.

**Note:** Patch Summary is informational; requirements and acceptance tests are defined in the referenced sections below.
**Acceptance Test References (informational):**
- Kill containment eligibility: see §2.2.3 Kill Mode Semantics acceptance tests.
- Staleness arithmetic: see §2.2.3 Policy Staleness Rule acceptance tests.
- /status required fields: see §7.0 acceptance tests.

> [!WARNING]
> **v5.2 F1_CERT Binding Requirement:** This version introduces F1_CERT binding validation (§2.2.1). ALL components that produce or consume `contract_version` MUST be updated to `5.2` in lockstep (F1 cert generator, runtime binary, PolicyGuard). Mismatched versions will force `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` until aligned.

## Patch Summary (P1 — Two-Layer Profile Isolation + CSP Kernel)

This Patch Summary is non-normative; see §0.0 for normative scope.

**Applied:** 2026-01-25  
**Objective:** Make CSP isolation mechanically enforceable and reduce the spec → code gap.

- **§0.Z.2.5 CSP Minimal Implementation Checklist** — Defines the smallest contract surface required to claim CSP.
- **§0.Z.7 Profile Isolation** — Defines `supported_profiles`/`enforced_profile`, mandates runtime + compile-time separation (CSP_ONLY build), and prohibits GOP inputs from affecting CSP safety decisions.
- **§0.Z.9 CSP-Only CI Gate** — Requires CI to prove CSP isolation via CSP_ONLY build/test gates.
- **§2.2.1.1 Critical Input Freshness** — Clarifies “critical inputs” are profile-scoped (GOP-only inputs are not critical in CSP).
- **§2.2.3 Axis Resolver** — Gates EvidenceChainState predicates on `enforced_profile != CSP`.
- **§7.0 /status Observability** — Adds required fields `supported_profiles` and `enforced_profile`; clarifies GOP extension key behavior under CSP.

**Acceptance Test References (informational):**
- CSP_ONLY build isolation: AT-990
- CSP runtime isolation: AT-991
- GOP enforcement check: AT-992

## Definitions
Profile: CSP

### Acceptance Test Isolation Requirements (Normative)

For any **new guard** (a rule, latch, monitor, or gate) that can block an OPEN, change TradingMode, or emit a SafetyOverride:

1) You MUST add a **paired** acceptance test set:
   - **TRIP AT**: the guard activates and is the *sole* reason an otherwise-valid OPEN is blocked / mode changes.
   - **NON-TRIP AT**: the guard does not activate and an otherwise-valid OPEN proceeds to dispatch.

2) Every TRIP/NON-TRIP AT for a guard MUST explicitly declare:
   - **All other gates forced pass** (Liquidity Gate pass, NetEdge pass, quantization pass, no unrelated latches, etc.).
   - Any required “normal” preconditions (fresh feeds, RiskState normal, no other cortex overrides).

3) “Downstream-only” tests (e.g., “if flag is already true…”) do NOT satisfy activation coverage.

4) Pass criteria MUST prove causality via at least one of:
   - dispatch count (0 vs 1),
   - specific reject reason code,
   - specific latch reason code,
   - specific `cortex_override` value.


- **instrument_kind**: one of `option | linear_future | inverse_future | perpetual` (derived from venue metadata).
  - **Linear Perpetuals (USDC‑margined)**: treat as `linear_future` for sizing (canonical `qty_coin`), even if their venue symbol says "PERPETUAL".
- **order_type** (Deribit `type`): `limit | market | stop_limit | stop_market | ...` (venue-specific).
- **linked_order_type**: Deribit linked/OCO semantics (venue-specific; gated off for this bot).
- **Aggressive IOC Limit**: a `limit` order with `time_in_force=immediate_or_cancel` and a *bounded* limit price computed from `fair_price` with fee-aware edge-based clamps (see §1.4).

- **L1TickerSnapshot**: {`instrument_id`, `best_bid`, `best_ask`, `ts_ms`, `source` (REST|WS)} from the ticker feed. Valid only if `best_bid > 0`, `best_ask > 0`, `best_bid <= best_ask`, and `(now_ms - ts_ms) <= l2_book_snapshot_max_age_ms`.

- **contract_version**: canonical version string `5.2` (numeric only; no codename/tagline).

- **RiskState** (health/cause layer): `Healthy | Degraded | Maintenance | Kill`
- **TradingMode** (enforcement layer): `Active | ReduceOnly | Kill`  
  Resolved by PolicyGuard each tick from RiskState, policy staleness, watchdog, exchange health, fee cache staleness, and Cortex overrides.
  **Runtime F1 Gate in PolicyGuard (HARD, runtime enforcement):** See §2.2.1 for canonical specification. Summary: F1_CERT missing/stale/invalid → ReduceOnly (blocks opens; allows closes/hedges/cancels).
- **TradingMode (term usage):** The term `TradingMode` refers exclusively to the PolicyGuard enum `Active | ReduceOnly | Kill`.
- **ExecutionStyle** (execution tactics layer): `Sniper` (IOC limit-only execution policy).
  - ExecutionStyle governs order construction and execution tactics only.
  - ExecutionStyle MUST NOT affect TradingMode computation or dispatch authorization.
- **reduce_only** (venue order flag): boolean on outbound order placement requests.
  - `reduce_only == true` -> classified as CLOSE/HEDGE (risk-reducing) for all "OPEN vs CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL" gates in this contract.
  - `reduce_only != true` (false or missing) -> classified as OPEN.
- **CANCEL intent**: cancel-only requests (no new order placement). Replace is treated as cancel + new order placement (classified above).
- **Fail-closed intent classification:** if an intent cannot be classified, it MUST be treated as OPEN.

AT-201
- Given: an OrderIntent with an unknown `action` value (not Place/Cancel/Close/Hedge) OR missing required classification fields.
- When: intent classification is computed.
- Then: classification MUST be OPEN, and OPEN gates (PolicyGuard mode + CP-001 latch (+ EvidenceGuard when `enforced_profile != CSP`)) MUST apply.
- Pass criteria: intent is treated as OPEN and blocked when any OPEN gate blocks.
- Fail criteria: intent is treated as CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL or bypasses OPEN gates.

AT-1055
- Given: `ExecutionStyle == Sniper`, and all PolicyGuard inputs and CSP gates are forced pass such that TradingMode would be Active.
- When: TradingMode is computed and an OPEN intent is evaluated for dispatch.
- Then: TradingMode remains Active and the OPEN is permitted; ExecutionStyle does not change TradingMode or dispatch authorization.
- Pass criteria: TradingMode Active and OPEN proceeds when CSP gates pass.
- Fail criteria: TradingMode ReduceOnly/Kill or OPEN blocked due solely to ExecutionStyle.

## **Phase 0: Operational Prerequisites (Non-Negotiable)**

Before any code implementation begins, these operational baseline items MUST be completed and evidenced. They establish the policy, environment, and operational controls required for safe system operation.

| ID | Item | Purpose | Evidence Required |
|----|------|---------|-------------------|
| **P0-A** | Launch Policy Baseline | Define explicit constraints on what the system is allowed to do | `docs/launch_policy.md` |
| **P0-B** | Environment Isolation | Document environment separation (DEV/STAGING/PAPER/LIVE) | `docs/env_matrix.md` |
| **P0-C** | Keys & Secrets Baseline | Document key creation rules, rotation plan, least-privilege proof | `docs/keys_and_secrets.md` |
| **P0-D** | Break-Glass Runbook + Drill | Create emergency halt procedure and execute recorded drill | `docs/break_glass_runbook.md`, drill evidence |
| **P0-E** | Health Endpoint Scaffolding | Implement `/status` returning `ok`, `build_id`, `contract_version` | `docs/health_endpoint.md`, passing tests |

**Rationale:** These items are operational controls, not system behavior specifications. They ensure the deployment environment is safe before any trading logic is implemented.

## **0.0 Normative Scope (Non-Negotiable)**
Profile: CSP

The numbered sections, Definitions, Appendix A, and Appendix CSP are normative. Non-numbered narrative elsewhere is informative and non-binding unless explicitly marked as an acceptance test.

## **0.X Repository Layout & Canonical Module Mapping (Non-Negotiable)**
Profile: CSP

This repo is a Rust workspace with two required crates:

- `crates/soldier_core`
- `crates/soldier_infra`

Any “Where:” references in this contract that mention `soldier/core/...` or `soldier/infra/...` map to:

- `soldier/core/...` => `crates/soldier_core/...`
- `soldier/infra/...` => `crates/soldier_infra/...`

Contract invariant: any implementation that relocates these crates or breaks this mapping is non-compliant unless `CONTRACT.md` is updated first.

**Contract acceptance criteria (repo-level):**
- `cargo test --workspace` must run from repo root.
- Both crates must exist and be members of the workspace.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-905
- Given: repo at root with `Cargo.toml` present.
- When: repo layout is verified.
- Then: `crates/soldier_core` and `crates/soldier_infra` exist and are listed in workspace members.
- Pass criteria: both crate paths exist and are workspace members.
- Fail criteria: missing crate path or missing workspace member entry.

## **0.Y Verification Harness (Non-Negotiable)**
Profile: CSP

`plans/verify.sh` is the canonical verification entrypoint for this repo.
It MUST be runnable from repo root and MUST invoke `cargo test --workspace`
as part of its core gate.

**Contract acceptance criteria (repo-level):**
- `bash -n plans/verify.sh` exits 0.
- `./plans/verify.sh` runs `cargo test --workspace` from repo root.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-901
- Given: repo at root with `plans/verify.sh` present.
- When: `plans/verify.sh` is executed.
- Then: it runs `cargo test --workspace` and exits `0` when tests pass.
- Pass criteria: exit code is `0` and the workspace tests run.
- Fail criteria: exits `0` when tests fail OR does not run workspace tests.



## **0.Z Compliance Profiles (Normative)**

### **0.Z.0 Purpose and Scope**

This section defines Compliance Profiles for this contract.

Compliance Profiles exist to:
- Prevent divergence between specification and implementability.
- Provide a deterministic definition of “safe to trade.”
- Separate capital-safety correctness from governance, analytics, and optimization concerns.
- Allow partial implementations that remain capital-safe by construction.

Compliance Profiles are normative.
Any implementation claiming compliance with this contract MUST declare:
- the highest profile it satisfies (“supported”), and
- the highest profile it enforces at runtime (“enforced”).

### **0.Z.1 Compliance Profile Definitions**

The contract defines the following profiles:

- **CSP — Core Safety Profile**
- **GOP — Governance & Optimization Profile**
- **FULL — Full Contract Profile (CSP + GOP)**

GOP extends CSP.
FULL compliance is satisfied iff both CSP and GOP are satisfied.

### **0.Z.2 Core Safety Profile (CSP) — Minimum Safe to Trade**

#### **0.Z.2.1 Definition** <!-- CSP-001 -->
<!-- Anchors: csp, safety, profile, minimal -->

The Core Safety Profile (CSP) defines the minimum set of guarantees required for live trading such that:
- Exposure cannot increase without an explicit OPEN permission.
- Duplicate or unintended orders cannot be emitted across restarts or retries.
- Safety-critical state transitions are panic-free and idempotent.
- If exposure exists, the system always has a deterministic, legal, risk-reducing action path.

An implementation that satisfies CSP is considered safe to trade even if governance, replay, optimization, or analytics features are absent or degraded.

#### **0.Z.2.2 CSP Mandatory Invariants (Non-Negotiable)**

An implementation claiming CSP compliance MUST enforce all of the following invariants:

**A) Idempotency & Deduplication** <!-- CSP-002 -->
<!-- Anchors: idempotency, dedup, label, hash -->
- Every outbound intent that may result in dispatch MUST be uniquely identifiable and deduplicable across:
  - retries
  - reconnects
  - process restarts
- Idempotency keys MUST be derived solely from deterministic intent identity fields (e.g., `group_id`, `leg_idx`, `intent_hash`, strategy/policy identifiers where applicable).
- Idempotency keys MUST NOT depend on wall-clock time, RNG, or process-local counters.

**B) RecordedBeforeDispatch for Risk-Increasing Actions** <!-- CSP-003 -->
<!-- Anchors: wal, recorded, dispatch, intent -->
- Every OPEN intent MUST satisfy RecordedBeforeDispatch before any network dispatch attempt.
- Failure to satisfy RecordedBeforeDispatch MUST fail-closed (OPEN blocked).
- “RecordedBeforeDispatch” MUST use the contract’s WAL semantics (Append-only, crash-safe intent log), as defined elsewhere in this contract.

**C) Restart & Reconciliation Correctness** <!-- CSP-004 -->
<!-- Anchors: restart, reconcile, latch, recovery -->
- On restart, the system MUST reconcile:
  - ledger intents
  - exchange open orders
  - exchange trades
  - exchange positions
- No intent MAY be re-sent unless reconciliation proves it unsent or safe to re-issue by idempotency identity.

**D) TradingMode Correctness** <!-- CSP-005 -->
<!-- Anchors: tradingmode, policyguard, mode, active -->
- The system MUST compute and enforce TradingMode:
  - Active
  - ReduceOnly
  - Kill
- OPEN intents MUST NOT dispatch unless TradingMode is Active.

**E) Open Permission Latch Semantics** <!-- CSP-006 -->
<!-- Anchors: latch, open_permission, CP-001, blocked -->
- After restart, WS gap, or session termination:
  - OPEN intents MUST be blocked
  - CLOSE / HEDGE / CANCEL intents MUST remain permitted (subject to Kill semantics)
- The latch MUST clear only after reconciliation succeeds.

**F) Capital Supremacy Invariant** <!-- CSP-007 -->
<!-- Anchors: capital, supremacy, containment, kill -->
- If exchange-reported exposure is non-zero (or exposure is unknown), the system MUST have at least one legal, deterministic risk-reducing action path.
- No system state MAY exist where:
  - exposure is non-zero/unknown, and
  - all CLOSE / HEDGE / CANCEL / emergency flatten actions are forbidden.
- If any subsystem would otherwise forbid all containment actions while exposure is non-zero/unknown, that subsystem MUST degrade in a way that preserves a risk-reducing action path.

**G) Deterministic Emergency Containment** <!-- CSP-008 -->
<!-- Anchors: emergency, close, flatten, bounded -->
- A bounded, deterministic emergency containment mechanism MUST exist.
- Emergency containment MUST be callable in:
  - ReduceOnly
  - Kill
  - degraded infrastructure states
- Emergency containment MUST be monotonic with respect to exposure (never increases risk).

**H) Timebase Authority (Safety-Critical)** <!-- CSP-009 -->
<!-- Anchors: monotonic, time, epoch, milliseconds -->
- All interval-based freshness / staleness checks that affect TradingMode MUST use a monotonic timebase for interval measurement.
- Wall-clock time MAY be recorded for observability, but MUST NOT be used as the authoritative basis for interval comparisons that trigger Kill.
- Clock uncertainty MAY force ReduceOnly, but MUST NOT force Kill.

#### **0.Z.2.3 CSP Explicit Non-Requirements**

The following are NOT REQUIRED for CSP compliance:
- TruthCapsule persistence
- Decision Snapshot persistence
- Replay simulation
- Canary rollout logic
- Optimization loops
- Attribution completeness beyond correctness needs

Failure or absence of the above MUST NOT, by itself, violate CSP invariants.
If any such subsystem is implemented, it MUST NOT be used to negate CSP guarantees (e.g., MUST NOT strand exposure or remove containment legality).

#### **0.Z.2.4 CSP Acceptance Tests**

All acceptance tests tagged:
`Profile: CSP`
are mandatory for any implementation that trades live.

Failure of any CSP-tagged test MUST block deployment.

#### **0.Z.2.5 CSP Minimal Implementation Checklist (Normative)**

To claim CSP compliance, an implementation MUST implement the following contract surfaces:

- §1.1 — Identity / Label Schema / Intent Hash stability
- §2.4 — WAL / intent ledger (RecordedBeforeDispatch)
- §2.2.1 — Runtime F1 Certification Gate (binding enforcement of build_id, runtime_config_hash, and contract_version; fail-closed to ReduceOnly)
- §2.2.3 — TradingMode computation + enforcement
- §2.2.4 — OpenPermissionLatch semantics (CP-001)
- §3.4 — Continuous 3-way reconciliation (restart + WS gap + session termination recovery)
- §3.1 — Deterministic Emergency Close / containment (bounded + deterministic)
- §7.0 — `/api/v1/status` minimum safety fields (including `supported_profiles` and `enforced_profile`)

All other sections are OPTIONAL for CSP.
If implemented, they MUST NOT negate CSP guarantees.

### **0.Z.3 Governance & Optimization Profile (GOP)**

#### **0.Z.3.1 Definition**

The Governance & Optimization Profile (GOP) defines requirements for:
- explainability
- analytics completeness
- replay-based validation
- automated policy rollout
- self-improvement loops

GOP extends CSP.
No implementation may claim GOP compliance unless it fully satisfies CSP.

#### **0.Z.3.2 GOP Mandatory Capabilities**

An implementation claiming GOP compliance MUST additionally provide:

**A) Truth Capsule & Decision Snapshot**
- Decision-time market context MUST be recorded for dispatched OPEN intents.
- TruthCapsule records MUST be joinable to executions and attribution.

**B) Evidence Chain Integrity**
- Attribution, snapshots, and truth records MUST be internally consistent.
- EvidenceChainState MUST be observable and surfaced.

**C) Replay Gatekeeper**
- Policy changes MUST be validated via replay over a bounded historical window.
- Replay failure MUST prevent unsafe policy rollout.

**D) Canary Rollout Governance**
- Policy changes MUST pass staged rollout with abort conditions.
- Abort logic MUST be deterministic and auditable.

**E) Optimization Loop**
- The system MAY auto-tune parameters subject to replay + canary approval.
- Unsafe or aggressive changes MUST require explicit approval.

#### **0.Z.3.3 GOP Failure Semantics**

GOP failures MUST NOT invalidate CSP guarantees.

GOP degradation MAY:
- freeze optimization
- force shadow-only operation
- prevent policy rollout

GOP degradation MUST NOT:
- strand exposure
- block emergency containment
- violate CSP invariants

#### **0.Z.3.4 GOP Acceptance Tests**

All acceptance tests tagged:
`Profile: GOP`
are REQUIRED to enable GOP features.

Failure of GOP-tagged tests MUST NOT block CSP-compliant trading, but MUST disable GOP features.

### **0.Z.4 Full Compliance Profile (FULL)**

An implementation is FULL-compliant iff:
- all CSP requirements are satisfied, and
- all GOP requirements are satisfied.

FULL compliance is REQUIRED for:
- unattended optimization
- automated policy promotion
- certification at the highest trust tier

### **0.Z.5 Acceptance Test Profile Tagging (Normative)**

Every acceptance test defined by this contract MUST be assigned to exactly one profile:
- `Profile: CSP` or
- `Profile: GOP`

ATs inherit the most recent `Profile:` tag above them.
Each AT definition MUST resolve to exactly one profile.

Assignment MUST be unambiguous and MAY be established by either:
- an explicit `Profile:` line on the acceptance test, OR
- profile inheritance from the nearest enclosing numbered section header that declares a profile.

If both exist, the explicit `Profile:` line wins.

CI systems MUST enforce profile-specific behavior:
- CSP test failure → deployment blocked
- GOP test failure → governance features disabled (trading may continue under CSP)

### **0.Z.6 Declaration of Compliance**

Any deployment MUST declare:
- its supported Compliance Profile(s), and
- the highest profile enforced at runtime.

Claiming a profile without enforcing all of its invariants is a contract violation.

### **0.Z.7 Profile Isolation (Normative)**
Profile: CSP

#### **0.Z.7.1 Definitions**

- `supported_profiles`: the set of profiles this build can enforce at runtime.
- `enforced_profile`: the profile currently enforced by this running deployment.

A deployment MUST expose both fields via `/api/v1/status` (see §7.0).

#### **0.Z.7.2 Runtime Isolation Rule (Hard)**

When `enforced_profile == CSP`, the system MUST treat all GOP-only subsystems as **nonexistent inputs**.

In particular, the following MUST NOT influence any CSP safety-critical decision:
- EvidenceChainState / EvidenceGuard
- TruthCapsule and Decision Snapshot writers (presence, health, lag, queue depth)
- Replay Gatekeeper results
- Canary rollout governor state
- Optimization loop state

A GOP subsystem failure under `enforced_profile == CSP`:
- MAY be logged / surfaced,
- MAY disable GOP features,
- but MUST NOT change:
  - `TradingMode`,
  - `OpenPermissionLatch`,
  - order legality of risk-reducing actions,
  - idempotency or reconciliation behavior.

#### **0.Z.7.3 Compile-Time Isolation Requirement (Hard)**

The codebase MUST support a build configuration in which GOP-only code is physically absent.

This configuration is called:

`CSP_ONLY build`

In a CSP_ONLY build:
- GOP-only modules MUST NOT be linked.
- GOP-only dependencies MUST be optional / feature-gated.
- The resulting binary MUST be capable of live trading under CSP.

#### **0.Z.7.4 Observability Requirement**

When `enforced_profile == CSP`, `/api/v1/status` MUST NOT claim GOP enforcement.
Any GOP-related health fields, if reported, MUST be clearly labeled as:
- `NOT_ENFORCED`, or
- omitted entirely.

#### **0.Z.7.5 Acceptance Tests (New)**

Profile: CSP
AT-990  
- Given: the repo is built in CSP_ONLY build mode (GOP feature set disabled).  
- When: the binary is started with a CSP config.  
- Then: it MUST start, and `/status.enforced_profile == CSP` and GOP subsystems are `NOT_ENFORCED` or absent.  
- Pass criteria: binary runs; CSP safety loop functions; no GOP dependency required.  
- Fail criteria: build fails, runtime requires GOP modules, or `/status` misreports enforcement.

Profile: CSP
AT-991  
- Given: `enforced_profile == CSP` and GOP subsystems are present but unhealthy (e.g., EvidenceChainState != GREEN, snapshot writer down).  
- When: a CSP-permitted OPEN decision is made (all CSP gates pass).  
- Then: the OPEN decision MUST NOT be blocked solely by GOP health.  
- Pass criteria: OPEN is permitted (or denied only by CSP gates).  
- Fail criteria: OPEN blocked by GOP health while `enforced_profile == CSP`.

Profile: GOP
AT-992  
- Given: `enforced_profile != CSP` and EvidenceChainState != GREEN.  
- When: a new OPEN intent is evaluated.  
- Then: the OPEN MUST be blocked and the system enters the contract-defined degraded mode.  
- Pass criteria: OPEN blocked exactly as specified.  
- Fail criteria: OPEN allowed despite EvidenceChain not GREEN.

### **0.Z.9 CSP-Only CI Gate (Normative)**
Profile: CSP

CI MUST provide a `CSP_ONLY` pipeline that proves CSP isolation mechanically.

Minimum required CI jobs:

1) `build:csp_only`
- Build the Rust workspace in CSP_ONLY mode (no GOP feature set).
- MUST succeed.

2) `test:csp_only`
- Run all `Profile: CSP` acceptance tests in CSP_ONLY mode.
- MUST pass. Failure MUST block deployment.

3) `test:gop`
- Run all `Profile: GOP` acceptance tests with GOP features enabled.
- Failure MUST disable GOP features, but MUST NOT block CSP deployments.

Recommended (non-normative) Rust commands:

- CSP_ONLY build:
  `cargo build --no-default-features --features csp_only`

- CSP_ONLY tests:
  `cargo test --no-default-features --features csp_only --test acceptance`

- GOP tests:
  `cargo test --features gop --test acceptance`




#### **0.Z.9.1 Meta-Acceptance Tests for CSP_ONLY CI Gate (REQUIRED)**

Profile: CSP
AT-1056  
- Given: the repository is at a clean commit.  
- When: the CI job `build:csp_only` builds the workspace in CSP_ONLY mode (GOP feature set disabled; reference invocation: `cargo build --no-default-features --features csp_only`).  
- Then: the build MUST succeed.  
- Pass criteria: job exits 0 and produces a runnable binary artifact.  
- Fail criteria: build fails or requires GOP-only features to compile.

Profile: CSP
AT-1057  
- Given: the workspace is built in CSP_ONLY mode (no GOP feature set).  
- When: the CI job `test:csp_only` runs the CSP acceptance suite in CSP_ONLY mode (GOP feature set disabled; reference invocation: `cargo test --no-default-features --features csp_only --test acceptance`).  
- Then: (a) all `Profile: CSP` acceptance tests MUST pass, and (b) no `Profile: GOP` acceptance test may execute in this pipeline.  
- Pass criteria: all CSP tests pass; runner reports 0 GOP tests executed; job exits 0.  
- Fail criteria: any CSP test fails, or any GOP test is executed in `test:csp_only`.

## Deribit Venue Facts Addendum (Artifact-Backed)

### Policy decision for DOC-CONFLICT (F-01b)

Even if **testnet** accepts market orders on options, this bot treats them as **DISALLOWED**.

**Rule:** For `instrument_kind == option`, the engine MUST:
- **Reject** `type=market` (or any payload lacking a limit price).  
  **No normalization/rewrite** is allowed; strategies must never emit market orders.

This policy is enforced in §1.4 (**No Market Orders**) and §1.4.4 (**Options Order-Type Guard**).

## **1\. Execution Architecture: The "Atomic Group" (Real-Time Repair)**
Profile: CSP

**Constraint**: We do not rely on API atomicity. We rely on **Runtime Atomicity**. If Leg A fills and Leg B dies, the system detects the "Mixed State" and neutralizes it immediately, without waiting for a restart.

### **1.0 Instrument Units & Notional Invariants (Deribit Quantity Contract) — MUST implement**

**Why this exists:** Unit mismatches are silent PnL killers. Deribit uses **different sizing semantics** across instruments. If we don’t encode these invariants, we will eventually ship a “correct-looking” trade that is 10–100× the intended exposure.

**Canonical internal units (single source of truth):**
- `qty_coin` (BTC/ETH): **options + linear futures** sizing.
- `qty_usd` (USD notional): **perpetual + inverse futures** sizing (Deribit `amount` is USD units for these).
- `notional_usd`:
  - For coin-sized instruments: `notional_usd = qty_coin * index_price`
  - For USD-sized instruments: `notional_usd = qty_usd`

**Hard Rules (Non‑Negotiable):**
1. **Never mix** coin sizing and USD sizing for the *same* intent. One is canonical; the other is derived.
2. If both `contracts` and `amount` are provided (internally or via strategy output), they **must match** within tolerance:
   - `amount ≈ contracts * contract_multiplier`  
   - `contract_multiplier` is instrument-specific (e.g., inverse futures contract size in USD; options contract multiplier in coin).
   - Tolerance: `abs(amount - contracts * contract_multiplier) / max(abs(amount), epsilon) <= contracts_amount_match_tolerance` where `contracts_amount_match_tolerance = 0.001` (0.1%, default) and `epsilon = 1e-9`.
3. If a mismatch is detected: **reject the intent** and set `RiskState::Degraded` (this is a wiring bug, not "market noise").
4. Rejections for contracts/amount mismatch MUST use `Rejected(ContractsAmountMismatch)`.
5. For `instrument_kind == option`, order size MUST use `qty_coin` (Deribit `amount` in base coin units); `qty_usd` MUST be unset.

**Acceptance Tests (References):**
- AT-277 (dispatcher mapping validates option sizing and `qty_usd` unset)

#### **1.0.X Instrument Metadata Freshness (Instrument Cache TTL) — MUST implement**

**Purpose:** Stale instrument metadata can silently break sizing and quantization (tick_size, amount_step, min_amount), causing wrong exposure.

**Source of truth (Non-Negotiable):**
- Instrument metadata MUST be fetched from `/public/get_instruments` and cached (Deribit).
- Hardcoding `tick_size`, `amount_step`, `min_amount`, or `contract_multiplier` is forbidden; all sizing/quantization MUST use the fetched metadata.

**Invariant (Non-Negotiable):**
- The engine MUST track freshness of instrument metadata used for:
  - instrument_kind derivation
  - quantization constraints (tick_size, amount_step, min_amount)
- If instrument metadata age exceeds `instrument_cache_ttl_s`:
  - set `RiskState::Degraded`
  - PolicyGuard MUST compute `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` within one tick (closes/hedges/cancels allowed; see §2.2.3)

**Required observability (contract-bound names):**
- `instrument_cache_age_s` (gauge)
- `instrument_cache_hits_total` (counter)
- `instrument_cache_stale_total` (counter)
- `instrument_cache_refresh_errors_total` (counter, optional but recommended)

**Acceptance tests (REQUIRED):**
- AT-104 below provides comprehensive testing for stale metadata handling (blocks opens, allows closes).

AT-104
- Given: `instrument_cache_age_s > instrument_cache_ttl_s` and an OPEN intent is proposed.
- When: the system evaluates eligibility for dispatch.
- Then: `RiskState==Degraded`, `TradingMode==ReduceOnly`, and the OPEN is rejected before dispatch; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL remain dispatchable (subject to Kill semantics in §2.2.3).
- Pass criteria: OPEN dispatch count remains 0; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL are not blocked solely by stale metadata.
- Fail criteria: any OPEN is dispatched while metadata is stale.

AT-333
- Given: instrument metadata is fetched from `/public/get_instruments`.
- When: quantization/sizing uses `tick_size`, `amount_step`, `min_amount`, and `contract_multiplier`.
- Then: values come from fetched metadata (no hardcoded defaults).
- Pass criteria: quantization/sizing uses fetched values.
- Fail criteria: any hardcoded defaults used.

#### **1.0.Y Instrument Lifecycle & Expiry Safety (Expiry Cliff Guard) — MUST implement**

**Purpose:** Instruments expire/delist. After expiry, venue APIs may return "invalid instrument"/"not_found"/"orderbook_closed".
These are **expected terminal lifecycle events**, not fatal system errors. The Soldier MUST remain panic-free and MUST protect
the rest of the portfolio from a single instrument disappearing.

**Required instrument fields (from venue metadata; cached under §1.0.X):**
- `expiration_timestamp_ms: Option<i64>` (epoch ms; null for perps)
- `is_active: bool` (or equivalent venue state)
- `instrument_state: enum { Active, DelistingSoon, ExpiredOrDelisted }` (derived)

**Delist buffer rule (fail-closed for opens):**
- If `expiration_timestamp_ms` is present and `now_ms >= expiration_timestamp_ms - (expiry_delist_buffer_s * 1000)`:
  - NEW OPEN intents for that instrument MUST be rejected before dispatch with `Rejected(InstrumentExpiredOrDelisted)`.
  - CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL intents remain allowed (subject to TradingMode semantics in §2.2.3 and other gates).

**Terminal error classification (panic-free):**
- Any venue response that semantically maps to {`invalid_instrument`, `not_found`, `orderbook_closed`, `instrument_not_open`}
  for an instrument with `expiration_timestamp_ms` present and `now_ms >= expiration_timestamp_ms` MUST be classified as:
  - `Terminal(InstrumentExpiredOrDelisted)`
  - MUST NOT panic
  - MUST NOT force process restart
  - MUST trigger reconciliation for that instrument only (ledger/orders/trades/positions) and then mark `instrument_state=ExpiredOrDelisted`.

**Idempotent cancel rule (expiry-safe):**
- If a CANCEL is issued for an order on an expired/delisted instrument and the venue returns a terminal lifecycle error,
  the CANCEL MUST be treated as **idempotently successful** (order is considered gone).

**Portfolio-wide reconcile/flatten (expiry-safe):**
- During any portfolio-wide reconcile/flatten procedure (restart reconcile, emergency flatten, operator shutdown flow),
  terminal lifecycle errors for expired/delisted instruments MUST NOT abort the procedure.
- The procedure MUST continue managing other instruments normally.
- If venue truth (positions snapshot) indicates no remaining position for the expired/delisted instrument, the system MUST
  mark `instrument_state=ExpiredOrDelisted` and MUST NOT enter a retry loop for that instrument.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-949
- Given: `expiration_timestamp_ms = Texp`, `now_ms = Texp + 1000`, and a CANCEL is attempted on that instrument.
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates expiry-safe idempotent cancel handling).
- When: venue returns a terminal lifecycle error (e.g., invalid instrument / not found / orderbook_closed).
- Then: the system does not panic; the cancel is treated as idempotently successful; the instrument is marked `ExpiredOrDelisted`;
  other instruments continue to be managed normally.
- Pass criteria: no crash; instrument_state updated; other instrument loop continues.
- Fail criteria: panic/crash or global trading halted solely due to this instrument error.

AT-950
- Given: `expiration_timestamp_ms = Texp`, `expiry_delist_buffer_s = 60`, and `now_ms = Texp - 30_000`.
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates the expiry delist OPEN block).
- When: an OPEN intent for that instrument is evaluated.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(InstrumentExpiredOrDelisted)` before dispatch; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL remain allowed.
- Pass criteria: OPEN dispatch count remains 0 and reject reason matches.
- Fail criteria: OPEN dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

AT-965
- Given:
  - `expiration_timestamp_ms = Texp`, `expiry_delist_buffer_s = 60`
  - `now_ms = Texp - 120_000` (outside the delist buffer)
  - instrument is active (not expired/delisted)
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates the expiry delist OPEN block)
- When: an OPEN intent for that instrument is evaluated.
- Then: it MUST NOT be rejected with `InstrumentExpiredOrDelisted`; it proceeds to dispatch.
- Pass criteria: dispatch count becomes 1 and there is no `Rejected(InstrumentExpiredOrDelisted)`.
- Fail criteria: OPEN rejected/blocked by the lifecycle guard despite being outside the delist buffer.

AT-966
- Given:
  - instrument is active (outside delist buffer; not expired/delisted)
  - a CANCEL intent for an existing order is handled and the venue returns success (or a normal non-terminal “already closed/canceled” response)
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates expiry-safe idempotent cancel logic)
- When: the CANCEL response is processed.
- Then: the system MUST NOT mark the instrument `ExpiredOrDelisted`; it treats the cancel as a normal success path.
- Pass criteria: instrument_state remains Active (or equivalent non-expired state).
- Fail criteria: instrument is incorrectly marked `ExpiredOrDelisted` from a non-terminal cancel result.


AT-960
- Given: a CANCEL intent on an expired/delisted instrument returns `Terminal(InstrumentExpiredOrDelisted)` at T0.
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates expiry-safe idempotent cancel handling).
- When: the same CANCEL intent is retried (duplicate) at T0+1.
- Then: the second attempt is a NOOP (idempotent success) and does not change ledger correctness.
- Pass criteria: no extra dispatch; ledger remains consistent.
- Fail criteria: repeated cancels cause errors, state corruption, or repeated network dispatch.

AT-961
- Given: a portfolio-wide reconcile/flatten is invoked with two instruments:
  - Instrument A is expired/delisted (`expiration_timestamp_ms = Texp`, `now_ms = Texp + 1000`)
  - Instrument B is active and has an open position requiring management
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates expiry-safe portfolio reconciliation).
- When: reconcile attempts cancel/close actions and instrument A returns a terminal lifecycle error, while instrument B proceeds normally.
- Then: the system MUST NOT panic; it MUST continue the procedure for instrument B; and it MUST NOT globally halt solely due to A.
- Pass criteria: B continues to be managed; no crash; A marked `ExpiredOrDelisted`.
- Fail criteria: global halt, crash, or B management stops because A expired.

AT-962
- Given: instrument A returns a terminal lifecycle error as above.
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates expiry-safe reconcile termination).
- When: a positions snapshot (venue truth) shows no remaining position for instrument A.
- Then: the system marks A `ExpiredOrDelisted` and MUST NOT retry cancel/close in a loop for A.
- Pass criteria: retry count for A remains 0 after reconciliation finalizes; state marked expired.
- Fail criteria: infinite/extended retries or repeated dispatch attempts for A after venue truth indicates no position.





**OrderSize struct (MUST implement):**
```rust
pub struct OrderSize {
  pub contracts: Option<i64>,     // integer contracts when applicable
  pub qty_coin: Option<f64>,      // BTC/ETH amount when applicable
  pub qty_usd: Option<f64>,       // USD amount when applicable
  pub notional_usd: f64,          // always populated (derived)
}
```

**Dispatcher Rules (Deribit request mapping):**
- Determine `instrument_kind` from instrument metadata (`option | linear_future | inverse_future | perpetual`).
- Compute size fields:
  - `option | linear_future`: canonical = `qty_coin`; derive `contracts` if contract multiplier is defined.
    - **Linear Perpetuals (USDC‑margined)** are treated as `linear_future`.
  - `perpetual | inverse_future`: canonical = `qty_usd`; derive `contracts = round(qty_usd / contract_size_usd)` (if defined) and `qty_coin = qty_usd / index_price`.
- **Deribit outbound order size field:** always send exactly one canonical “amount” value:
  - coin instruments → send `amount = qty_coin`
  - USD-sized instruments → send `amount = qty_usd`
- If `contracts` exists, it must be consistent with the canonical amount before dispatch (reject if not).

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-277
- Given:
  1) `instrument_kind=option` with `qty_coin=0.3` at `index_price=100_000`
  2) `instrument_kind=perpetual` with `qty_usd=30_000` at `index_price=100_000`
- When: the dispatcher maps request fields.
- Then:
  - outbound option uses `amount=0.3` (coin), `notional_usd=30_000`, and `qty_usd` is unset
  - outbound perp uses `amount=30_000` (USD), `qty_coin=0.3`, `notional_usd=30_000`
  - if both `contracts` and `amount` are supplied and mismatch → reject + degrade
- Pass criteria: mapping rules applied; option `qty_usd` unset; mismatches rejected.
- Fail criteria: incorrect mapping or mismatch allowed.

AT-920
- Given: `contracts` and `amount` are provided and mismatch beyond `contracts_amount_match_tolerance`.
- When: the dispatcher validates sizing before dispatch.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(ContractsAmountMismatch)` and no dispatch occurs.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; dispatch count remains 0; `RiskState==Degraded`.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

### **1.1 Labeling & Idempotency Contract**

**Requirement**: Every order must be uniquely identifiable and deduplicable across restarts, socket reconnections, and race conditions.

**Specification: The Label Schema**

**Canonical Outbound Format (MUST implement):** `s4:{sid8}:{gid12}:{li}:{ih16}`

- `sid8` = first 8 chars of stable strategy id hash (e.g., base32(xxhash(strat_id)))
- `gid12` = first 12 chars of group_id (uuid without dashes, truncated)
- `li` = leg_idx (0/1)
- `ih16` = 16-hex (or base32) intent hash

**Deribit Constraint:** `label` must be <= 64 chars. (Hard limit)

**Rule:** All outbound orders to Deribit MUST use the `s4:` format. For `s4` labels, truncation MUST NOT occur; if a computed label would exceed 64 chars, the intent MUST be rejected before dispatch and `RiskState` MUST become `Degraded`.
Rejections for label-length overflow MUST use `Rejected(LabelTooLong)`.

**Legacy Documentation Format (non-sent):** `s4:{strat_id}:{group_id}:{leg_idx}:{intent_hash}`  
This expanded format is for human-readable logs and internal documentation only. It MUST NOT be sent to the exchange.

#### **1.1.2 Label Parse + Disambiguation (Collision-Safe)**

**Requirement:** Label collisions can still occur (hash collisions or non-conforming labels). The Soldier must deterministically map exchange orders to local intents.

**Where:** `soldier/core/recovery/label_match.rs`

**Algorithm:**
1) Parse label → extract `{sid8, gid12, leg_idx, ih16}`.
2) Candidate set = all local intents where:
   - `gid12` matches AND `leg_idx` matches.
3) If candidate set size == 1 → match.
4) Else disambiguate using the following tie-breakers in order:
   A) `ih16` match (first 16 chars of intent_hash)
   B) instrument match
   C) side match
   D) qty_q match
5) If still ambiguous → mark `RiskState::Degraded`, block opens, and require REST trade/order snapshot reconcile.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-216
- Given: an outbound order intent is built with a valid `s4:` label.
- When: the label parser runs.
- Then: the label starts with `s4:`, length ≤ 64 chars, and parser extracts `{sid8, gid12, li, ih16}` correctly.
- Pass criteria: parser outputs match expected components and label length is within bounds.
- Fail criteria: label format invalid, length > 64, or parsed components mismatch.

AT-217
- Given: two intents share the same `gid12` and `leg_idx`.
- When: the label matcher disambiguates using tie-breakers.
- Then: it resolves using `ih16` + instrument + side; if still ambiguous, `RiskState::Degraded` and opens blocked.
- Pass criteria: deterministic match when tie-breakers suffice; Degraded + opens blocked on unresolved ambiguity.
- Fail criteria: ambiguous mapping accepted or opens proceed without Degraded on unresolved ambiguity.

AT-041
- Given: a generated `s4` label would exceed 64 chars.
- When: the system attempts to create an OrderIntent.
- Then: the intent is rejected before dispatch and `RiskState==Degraded`.
- Pass criteria: no order is sent; `/status` shows `RiskState::Degraded`; `mode_reasons` includes a label-length reason code if defined.
- Fail criteria: any order dispatch occurs or `RiskState` remains Active.

AT-921
- Given: a generated `s4` label would exceed 64 chars.
- When: the system attempts to create an OrderIntent.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(LabelTooLong)` and no dispatch occurs.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; dispatch count remains 0; `RiskState==Degraded`.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.



* `strat_id`: Static ID of the running strategy (e.g., `strangle_btc_low_vol`).  
* `group_id`: UUIDv4 (Shared by all legs in a single atomic attempt).  
* `leg_idx`: `0` or `1` (Identity within the group).  
* `intent_hash`: `xxhash64(instrument + side + qty_q + limit_price_q + group_id + leg_idx)` (see §1.1.1 for quantization)  
  **Hard rule:** Do NOT include wall-clock timestamps in the idempotency hash.

AT-343
- Given: two intents with identical canonical fields (instrument, side, qty_q, limit_price_q, group_id, leg_idx) evaluated at different wall-clock times.
- When: `intent_hash` is computed for both.
- Then: the two `intent_hash` values are identical.
- Pass criteria: `intent_hash(t0) == intent_hash(t1)` for identical canonical fields.
- Fail criteria: hash differs solely due to wall-clock time.

AT-933
- Given: a WS reconnect occurs and the exchange still has open orders for an existing `group_id`.
- When: the system re-fetches open orders and matches by `group_id`.
- Then: no duplicate dispatch occurs and the existing orders are treated as in-flight.
- Pass criteria: dispatch count remains 0 for duplicates; reconciliation succeeds.
- Fail criteria: duplicate dispatch occurs or orders are treated as missing.


### **1.1.1 Canonical Quantization (Pre-Hash & Pre-Dispatch)**

**Requirement:** All idempotency keys and order payloads MUST use canonical, exchange-valid rounded values.

**Where:** `soldier/core/execution/quantize.rs`

**Inputs:** `instrument_id`, `raw_qty`, `raw_limit_price`  
**Outputs:** `qty_q`, `limit_price_q` (quantized)

**Rules (Deterministic):**
- Fetch instrument constraints: `tick_size`, `amount_step`, `min_amount`.
- If any of `tick_size`, `amount_step`, or `min_amount` is missing or unparseable -> Reject(intent=InstrumentMetadataMissing) and do not dispatch (fail-closed).
- `qty_q = round_down(raw_qty, amount_step)` (never round up size).
- `limit_price_q = round_to_nearest_tick(raw_limit_price, tick_size)` (or round in the safer direction; see below).
- If `qty_q < min_amount` → Reject(intent=TooSmallAfterQuantization).
- Idempotency hash must be computed ONLY from quantized fields:
  `intent_hash = xxhash64(instrument + side + qty_q + limit_price_q + group_id + leg_idx)`

**Safer rounding direction:**
- For BUY: round `limit_price_q` DOWN (never pay extra).
- For SELL: round `limit_price_q` UP (never sell cheaper).

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-218
- Given: two codepaths compute the same intent fields.
- When: `intent_hash` is generated.
- Then: both hashes are identical.
- Pass criteria: `intent_hash` equality across codepaths.
- Fail criteria: hash mismatch for identical inputs.

AT-219
- Given: raw BUY and SELL prices that are not on tick.
- When: quantization runs.
- Then: BUY rounds down and SELL rounds up (never worse price).
- Pass criteria: BUY price never increases; SELL price never decreases.
- Fail criteria: BUY rounds up or SELL rounds down.

AT-908
- Given: `qty_q < min_amount` after quantization for an OPEN intent.
- When: quantization runs.
- Then: intent is rejected with `Rejected(TooSmallAfterQuantization)` and no dispatch occurs.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; dispatch count remains 0.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

AT-926
- Given: instrument metadata is missing/unparseable (`tick_size` or `amount_step` or `min_amount`).
- When: quantization runs for an OPEN intent.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(InstrumentMetadataMissing)` and no dispatch occurs.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; dispatch count remains 0.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or an implicit default is used.

AT-928
- Given: the WAL already contains `intent_hash` for a pending intent.
- When: the system evaluates a new intent with the same `intent_hash`.
- Then: it is a NOOP (no dispatch; no new WAL entry).
- Pass criteria: dispatch count remains 0; WAL unchanged.
- Fail criteria: a duplicate dispatch occurs or WAL duplicates the intent.

**Idempotency Rules (Non-Negotiable):**
1. **Dedupe-on-Send (Local):** Before dispatch, check `intent_hash` in the WAL. If exists → NOOP.
2. **Dedupe-on-Send (Remote):** Use Deribit `label` as the idempotency key. If WS reconnect occurs, re-fetch open orders and match by `group_id`.
3. **Replay Safe:** On restart, rebuild “in-flight intents” from WAL, then reconcile with exchange orders/trades. Never resend an intent unless WAL state says it is unsent.
4. **Attribution-Keyed:** Every fill must map to `group_id` + `leg_idx`, so we can compute “atomic slippage” per group.


### **1.2 Atomic Group Executor**

**Requirement:** Manage multi-leg intent as a single atomic unit under messy reality (rejects, partials, WS gaps). We do **Runtime Atomicity**: detect atomicity breaks and deterministically contain/flatten.

### **1.2.1 GroupState Serialization Invariant (Seed “First Fail”)**
**Council Weakness Covered:** Premature “Complete” + naked events under concurrency.

**Hard Invariant (Non‑Negotiable):**
- A Group may be marked `Complete` **only if** every leg has reached a terminal TLSM state `{Filled, Canceled, Rejected}` **AND**
  - the group has **no partial fills** and **no fill mismatch** beyond `epsilon` (atomicity restored or no-trade), **AND**
  - **no containment/rescue action is pending**.
- The **first observed failure** (reject/cancel/unfilled/partial mismatch) must “seed” the group into `MixedFailed` and **must not be overwritten** by later async updates.

**Serialization Rule:**
- GroupState transitions must be **single-writer** (AtomicGroupExecutor owns state) or protected by a **group‑level lock**.
- Leg TLSM events may arrive concurrently; **only** the executor decides when/if the group can advance to `Complete`.
- Lock acquisition MUST be bounded (try_lock/timeout) with `group_lock_max_wait_ms` (Appendix A). If not acquired within the bound, the hot loop MUST NOT block and MUST force ReduceOnly until the lock clears.

**Fail-Closed Rule:**
- Group intent MUST be durably recorded before any leg dispatch. If persistence fails, the executor MUST abort and MUST NOT submit any leg orders.

**Where:** `soldier/core/execution/atomic_group_executor.rs`

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-220
- Given: leg events arrive out of order (A fills fast, B rejects late).
- When: GroupState serialization is evaluated.
- Then: the group is never recorded `Complete` before B reaches terminal, and the first failure deterministically triggers containment → flatten.
- Pass criteria: no premature `Complete`; containment triggers on first failure.
- Fail criteria: `Complete` recorded early or containment not triggered.

AT-924
- Given: the group-level lock is held longer than `group_lock_max_wait_ms`.
- When: AtomicGroupExecutor attempts to acquire the lock in the hot loop.
- Then: the hot loop does not block and TradingMode is forced to ReduceOnly until the lock clears.
- Pass criteria: no stall; ReduceOnly enforced; OPEN blocked.
- Fail criteria: hot loop blocks or OPEN dispatch occurs while lock is unavailable.

**Implementation (Rust Skeleton):** `soldier/core/execution/group.rs`

```rust
pub enum GroupState { New, Dispatched, Complete, MixedFailed, Flattening, Flattened }

pub struct AtomicGroup {
  pub group_id: Uuid,
  pub legs: Vec<OrderIntent>,
  pub state: GroupState,
}

pub struct LegResult {
  pub leg_idx: u8,
  pub requested_qty: f64,
  pub filled_qty: f64,     // 0.0 .. requested_qty
  pub rejected: bool,
  pub unfilled: bool,
}

pub async fn execute_atomic_group(&self, group: AtomicGroup) -> Result<()> {
  // 0) Persist group intent BEFORE network
  self.ledger.append_group_intent(&group)?;

  // 1) Dispatch legs concurrently as IOC limits (never market)
  let futs = group.legs.iter().map(|leg| self.dispatch_ioc_limit(leg));
  let mut results: Vec<LegResult> = join_all(futs).await;

  // 2) Classify outcomes (qty-aware)
  let filled_qtys: Vec<f64> = results.iter().map(|r| r.filled_qty).collect();
  let max_f = filled_qtys.iter().cloned().fold(f64::NEG_INFINITY, f64::max);
  let min_f = filled_qtys.iter().cloned().fold(f64::INFINITY, f64::min);
  let any_partial = results.iter().any(|r| r.filled_qty > 0.0 && r.filled_qty < r.requested_qty);

  // New rule: partials are common; treat mismatch as atomicity break
  let group_fill_mismatch = max_f - min_f;
  let epsilon = self.cfg.atomic_qty_epsilon;

  // 3) Atomicity broken ⇒ enter MixedFailed and run Containment
  if any_partial || group_fill_mismatch > epsilon {

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-116
- Given: AtomicGroup with Leg A filled and Leg B rejected.
- When: group result is evaluated.

- Pass criteria: MixedFailed is recorded and exposure is flattened before any OPEN dispatch.
- Fail criteria: group marked Complete or OPEN dispatch occurs while exposure remains non-neutral.

AT-117
- Given: Leg A fills `0.6`, Leg B fills `0.0`.
- When: rescue IOC attempts execute.
- Then: at most **2** rescue IOC attempts occur; if mismatch persists, deterministic flatten executes.

- Fail criteria: >2 rescue attempts or mismatch persists without flatten.

AT-118
- Given: mixed-state where one leg is filled and another is rejected.
- When: containment path executes.

- Fail criteria: emergency close not executed or OPENs allowed while exposure persists.

AT-935
- Given: `append_group_intent` fails to persist the group intent.
- When: AtomicGroupExecutor attempts to dispatch legs.

- Given: a MixedFailed group where LiquidityGate or Net Edge would reject rescue orders.
- When: containment Step A evaluates rescue dispatch.

- Pass criteria: rescue dispatch count remains 0 under gate reject; emergency close invoked.
- Fail criteria: rescue orders are submitted when a gate rejects or Step B does not run.



### **1.2.2 Atomic Churn Circuit Breaker (Flatten Storm Guard)**
**Goal:** Prevent “death‑by‑fees” churn when a strategy repeatedly legs, partially fills, then emergency‑flattens.

**Rule (Deterministic):**
- Maintain a rolling counter keyed by `{strategy_id, structure_fingerprint}` where `structure_fingerprint` can be `(instrument_kind, tenor_bucket, delta_bucket, legs_signature)`.
- If `EmergencyFlattenGroup` triggers **> 2 times in 5 minutes** for the same key → **Blacklist** that key for **15 minutes**:
  - block new opens for that key (return `Rejected(ChurnBreakerActive)`),
  - allow closes/hedges (ReduceOnly) as normal.

**Where:** `soldier/core/risk/churn_breaker.rs`

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-221
- Given: 3 EmergencyFlattenGroup triggers for the same key within 5 minutes.
- When: a 4th attempt is evaluated.
- Then: the 4th attempt is rejected and logged (`ChurnBreakerTrip`), with blacklist TTL enforced.
- Pass criteria: rejection + log + TTL enforcement.
- Fail criteria: 4th attempt proceeds or TTL not enforced.

### **1.2.3 Self-Impact Feedback Loop Guard (Echo Chamber Breaker)**

**Goal:** Prevent the bot from reacting to its own impact and recursively increasing exposure (“echo chamber”).
This is a **safety guard**, not a strategy feature.

**Where:** `soldier/core/risk/self_impact_guard.rs`

**Inputs (minimum):**
- Rolling public market volume estimate over `feedback_loop_window_s` (USD notional): `public_notional_usd`
- Rolling self trade notional over the same window (USD notional): `self_notional_usd`
- `public_trades_last_update_ts_ms` (epoch ms; freshness timestamp for public trade feed aggregation)
- `now_ms`
- Intended action classification (OPEN vs CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL)

**Freshness precondition (non-negotiable):**
- If `now_ms - public_trades_last_update_ts_ms > public_trade_feed_max_age_ms` OR the field is missing/unparseable:
  - The Self-Impact guard MUST NOT compute `self_fraction`.
  - Instead, the system MUST treat this as a trades-feed liveness failure:
    - Set `RiskState::Degraded`
    - Set Open Permission Latch reason `WS_TRADES_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`
    - Block opens until reconciliation clears the latch.

**Computation (only when feed is fresh):**
- `self_fraction = self_notional_usd / max(public_notional_usd, epsilon)`
- Trip condition (any):
  A) `self_fraction >= self_trade_fraction_trip` AND `self_notional_usd >= self_trade_min_self_notional_usd`
  B) `self_notional_usd >= self_trade_notional_trip_usd`
- If trip condition is met for a proposed OPEN in the same direction as recent self trades:
  - Reject the OPEN intent before dispatch with `Rejected(FeedbackLoopGuardActive)`
  - Apply cooldown: block further OPENs for `feedback_loop_cooldown_s` for the affected `{strategy_id, structure_fingerprint}` key.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-953
- Given: `public_trades_last_update_ts_ms` is stale beyond `public_trade_feed_max_age_ms`.
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates stale-feed handling for the Self-Impact guard).
- When: the Self-Impact guard evaluates a new OPEN intent.
- Then: it does NOT compute `self_fraction`; it sets `RiskState::Degraded` and sets Open Permission Latch reason `WS_TRADES_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`.
- Pass criteria: OPEN blocked due to latch; no `Rejected(FeedbackLoopGuardActive)` is emitted.
- Fail criteria: FeedbackLoopGuard trips (or computes) while trade feed is stale OR OPEN dispatch occurs.

AT-955
- Given:
  - `feedback_loop_window_s = 10`
  - trade feed is fresh: `public_trades_last_update_ts_ms = now_ms - 1000` and `public_trade_feed_max_age_ms = 5000`
  - `self_trade_fraction_trip = 0.25` and `self_trade_min_self_notional_usd = 10_000`
  - `public_notional_usd = 100_000` and `self_notional_usd = 40_000` (so `self_fraction = 0.40`)
  - Proposed action is an **OPEN** in the same direction as recent self trades
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates the Self-Impact guard)
- When: an OPEN intent is evaluated.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(FeedbackLoopGuardActive)` and no dispatch occurs.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; dispatch count remains 0.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs, rejection missing/mismatched, or guard fails to compute trip from the provided notional inputs.

AT-956
- Given:
  - trade feed is fresh (as above)
  - `self_trade_notional_trip_usd = 150_000`
  - `public_notional_usd = 10_000_000` and `self_notional_usd = 200_000` (so self_fraction is small but notional is large)
  - Proposed action is an **OPEN** in the same direction as recent self trades
  - All other gates are configured to pass
- When: an OPEN intent is evaluated.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(FeedbackLoopGuardActive)` via the notional-trip rule.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; dispatch count remains 0.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or the guard ignores the notional-trip path.

AT-957
- Given:
  - trade feed is fresh (as above)
  - `self_trade_fraction_trip = 0.25` and `self_trade_min_self_notional_usd = 10_000`
  - `self_trade_notional_trip_usd = 150_000`
  - `public_notional_usd = 200_000` and `self_notional_usd = 20_000` (so `self_fraction = 0.10`, below threshold; notional below trip)
  - All other gates are configured to pass (isolate Self-Impact guard)
- When: an OPEN intent is evaluated.
- Then: the Self-Impact guard MUST NOT reject with `FeedbackLoopGuardActive`; the intent proceeds to dispatch.
- Pass criteria: dispatch count becomes 1 and there is no `Rejected(FeedbackLoopGuardActive)`.
- Fail criteria: guard rejects despite being below thresholds.


### **1.3 Pre-Trade Liquidity Gate (Do Not Sweep the Book)**

**Council Weakness Covered:** No Liquidity Gate (Low) \+ Taker Bleed (Critical). **Requirement:** Before any order is sent (including IOC), the Soldier must estimate book impact for the requested size and reject trades that exceed max slippage. **Where:** `soldier/core/execution/gate.rs` **Input:** `OrderQty`, `L2BookSnapshot`, `max_slippage_bps = 10` (default: see Appendix A)

If `L2BookSnapshot` is missing, unparseable, or older than `l2_book_snapshot_max_age_ms` (Appendix A), LiquidityGate MUST reject OPEN intents. CLOSE/HEDGE/replace order placement is rejected; CANCEL-only intents remain allowed. Deterministic Emergency Close is exempt from profitability gates, but still requires a valid price source; if L2 is missing/stale it MUST use the §3.1 fallback price source and MUST block only if no fallback source is valid.
Rejections due to missing/unparseable/stale L2 MUST use `Rejected(LiquidityGateNoL2)`.

**Output:** `Allowed | Rejected(reason=ExpectedSlippageTooHigh)`

**Algorithm (Deterministic):**

1. Walk the L2 book on the correct side (asks for buy, bids for sell).  
2. Compute the Weighted Avg Price (WAP) for `OrderQty`.  
3. Compute expected slippage: `slippage_bps = (WAP - BestPrice) / BestPrice * 10_000` (sign adjusted)  
4. Reject if `slippage_bps` > `max_slippage_bps` (default 10bps; `max_slippage_bps` from Appendix A).  
5. If rejected, log `LiquidityGateReject` with computed WAP \+ slippage.

**Scope (explicit):**
- Applies to normal dispatch and containment rescue IOC orders (see §1.1 containment Step A).
- Does NOT apply to Deterministic Emergency Close (§3.1) or containment Step B; emergency close MUST NOT be blocked by profitability gates.
- Emergency close still requires a valid price source; missing/stale L2 MUST use the §3.1 fallback price source and MUST block only if no fallback source is valid.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-222
- Given: an L2 book where `OrderQty` requires consuming multiple levels causing `slippage_bps > max_slippage_bps`.
- When: Liquidity Gate evaluates the order.
- Then: intent is rejected with `Rejected(ExpectedSlippageTooHigh)` and a `LiquidityGateReject` log; no `OrderIntent` is emitted.
- Pass criteria: rejection + log; pricer/NetEdge gate does not run.
- Fail criteria: order proceeds or log missing.
- And: emergency close proceeds even if Liquidity Gate would reject under the same slippage conditions.

AT-344
- Given: `L2BookSnapshot` is missing, unparseable, or older than `l2_book_snapshot_max_age_ms`.
- When: Liquidity Gate evaluates an OPEN intent.
- Then: the intent is rejected (no dispatch) and a LiquidityGate rejection is logged.
- Pass criteria: no OPEN dispatch occurs; rejection reason recorded.
- Fail criteria: OPEN dispatch proceeds without a valid L2 snapshot.

AT-909
- Given: `L2BookSnapshot` is missing, unparseable, or older than `l2_book_snapshot_max_age_ms` for an OPEN.
- When: Liquidity Gate evaluates the order.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(LiquidityGateNoL2)` and no dispatch occurs.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; dispatch count remains 0.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

AT-421
- Given: `L2BookSnapshot` is missing, unparseable, or older than `l2_book_snapshot_max_age_ms`.
- When: a CANCEL-only intent and a CLOSE/HEDGE order placement intent are evaluated.
- Then: CANCEL is allowed; CLOSE/HEDGE order placement is rejected (no dispatch).
- Pass criteria: cancel proceeds; close/hedge is rejected.
- Fail criteria: close/hedge proceeds or cancel is blocked.



### **1.4 Fee-Aware IOC Limit Pricer (No Market Orders)**
**Council Weakness Covered:** Taker Bleed (Critical) + Fee Blindness (High)

**Where:** `soldier/core/execution/pricer.rs`  
**Input:** `fair_price`, `gross_edge_usd`, `min_edge_usd`, `fee_estimate_usd`, `qty`, `side`  
**Output:** `limit_price`

**Rule:**
- `net_edge = gross_edge - fees`
- If `net_edge < min_edge` ⇒ reject.
- `net_edge_per_unit = net_edge / qty`
- Compute per-unit bounds:
  - `fee_per_unit = fee_estimate_usd / qty`
  - `min_edge_per_unit = min_edge_usd / qty`
  - `max_price_for_min_edge`:
    - BUY: `fair_price - (min_edge_per_unit + fee_per_unit)`
    - SELL: `fair_price + (min_edge_per_unit + fee_per_unit)`
- Proposed limit from fill aggressiveness:  
  `proposed_limit = fair_price ± 0.5 * net_edge_per_unit` (sign depends on buy/sell)
- Final limit **clamped** to guarantee min edge at the limit price:
  - BUY: `limit_price = min(proposed_limit, max_price_for_min_edge)`
  - SELL: `limit_price = max(proposed_limit, max_price_for_min_edge)`
- If IOC returns unfilled/partial: **do not chase**. The missed trade is the cost of not dying.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-223
- Given: a widened spread and an IOC limit order.
- When: execution occurs.
- Then: the system never fills worse than `limit_price` and `Realized Edge >= Min_Edge` at the limit price.
- Pass criteria: no fills beyond `limit_price`; realized edge meets minimum.
- Fail criteria: fill worse than `limit_price` or realized edge below minimum.


### **1.4.1 Net Edge Gate (Fees + Expected Slippage)**
**Why this exists:** Prevent “gross edge” hallucinations from bypassing execution safety.

**Where:** `soldier/core/execution/gates.rs`  
**Input:** `gross_edge_usd`, `fee_usd`, `expected_slippage_usd`, `min_edge_usd`  
**Output:** `Allowed | Rejected(reason=NetEdgeTooLow)`

**Rule (Non-Negotiable):**
- `net_edge_usd = gross_edge_usd - fee_usd - expected_slippage_usd`
- If any of `gross_edge_usd`, `fee_usd`, `expected_slippage_usd`, or `min_edge_usd` is missing/unparseable -> Reject(intent=NetEdgeInputMissing) and do not dispatch (fail-closed).
- Reject if `net_edge_usd < min_edge_usd`.

**Hard Rule:**
- This gate MUST run **before** any `OrderIntent` is eligible for dispatch (before AtomicGroup creation).

**Scope (explicit):**
- Applies to normal dispatch and containment rescue IOC orders (see §1.1 containment Step A).
- Does NOT apply to Deterministic Emergency Close (§3.1) or reduce-only close/hedge intents.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**

AT-015
- Given: `net_edge_usd < min_edge_usd`.
- When: an OPEN intent is evaluated by the Net Edge Gate.
- Then: the OPEN intent is rejected and MUST NOT dispatch.
- Pass criteria: zero dispatch for that OPEN.
- Fail criteria: OPEN dispatch occurs.

AT-327
- Given: Net Edge Gate would reject under net edge conditions.
- When: Deterministic Emergency Close runs.
- Then: emergency close proceeds despite Net Edge Gate rejection.
- Pass criteria: emergency close dispatch occurs.
- Fail criteria: emergency close blocked by Net Edge Gate.

AT-932
- Given: `fee_usd` or `expected_slippage_usd` is missing/unparseable for an OPEN intent.
- When: the Net Edge Gate evaluates the intent.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(NetEdgeInputMissing)` and no dispatch occurs.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; dispatch count remains 0.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or an implicit default is used.


### **1.4.2 Inventory Skew Gate (Execution Bias vs Current Exposure)**
**Why this exists:** Prevent “good trades” from compounding the *wrong* inventory when already near limits.

**Input:** `current_delta`, `delta_limit`, `side`, `min_edge_usd`, `limit_price`, `fair_price`  
**Output:** `Allowed | Rejected(reason=InventorySkew)` and **adjusted** `{min_edge_usd, limit_price}`

**Input Definition:**
`delta_limit` is absolute delta in underlying units (strategy’s delta convention) and MUST be provided by policy/config; missing ⇒ reject OPEN intents (fail-closed).
Rejections for missing `delta_limit` MUST use `Rejected(InventorySkewDeltaLimitMissing)`.

**Rule:**
- `inventory_bias = clamp(current_delta / delta_limit, -1, +1)`  
  (positive = already long delta; negative = already short delta)

**Biasing behavior (deterministic):**
- **BUY intents when `inventory_bias > 0` (already long):**
  - Require higher edge: `min_edge_usd := min_edge_usd * (1 + inventory_skew_k * inventory_bias)` where `inventory_skew_k = 0.5` (default; see Appendix A)
  - Be less aggressive: shift `limit_price` **away** from the touch by `bias_ticks(inventory_bias)` where `bias_ticks(x) = ceil(abs(x) * inventory_skew_tick_penalty_max)` and `inventory_skew_tick_penalty_max = 3` (default; see Appendix A)
- **SELL intents when `inventory_bias > 0` (already long):**
  - Allow slightly lower edge (within bounds) and/or be more aggressive to **flatten** inventory
- Mirror the above for `inventory_bias < 0` (already short).

**Hard Rule:**
- Inventory Skew runs **after** Net Edge Gate and **before** pricer dispatch. If it adjusts `min_edge_usd`, the Net Edge Gate MUST be re-evaluated against the adjusted `min_edge_usd` before dispatch; the adjusted value is authoritative for dispatch eligibility.
- Inventory Skew may *tighten* requirements for risk-increasing trades and *loosen* requirements only for risk-reducing trades.
- Inventory Skew must be computed using **current + pending** exposure, or it must run **after** PendingExposure reservation (see §1.4.2.1). This prevents concurrent risk-budget double-spend.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-224
- Given: `current_delta ≈ 0.9 * delta_limit` (near limit).
- When: Inventory Skew evaluates BUY and SELL intents.
- Then: BUY intent that previously passed Net Edge is rejected; SELL intent passes (risk-reducing); SELL intent that initially fails Net Edge passes after `min_edge_usd` adjustment and re-evaluation.
- Pass criteria: BUY rejected; SELL allowed; re-evaluation uses adjusted `min_edge_usd`.
- Fail criteria: BUY allowed or SELL rejected contrary to rules.

AT-043
- Given: `delta_limit` is missing/unparseable.
- When: an OPEN intent enters Inventory Skew Gate evaluation.
- Then: intent is rejected and RiskState is Degraded (or equivalent fail-closed outcome).
- Pass criteria: no OPEN dispatch occurs.
- Fail criteria: OPEN proceeds with an implicit/zero default.

AT-922
- Given: `delta_limit` is missing/unparseable.
- When: an OPEN intent enters Inventory Skew Gate evaluation.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(InventorySkewDeltaLimitMissing)` and no dispatch occurs.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; dispatch count remains 0.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

AT-030
- Given: `inventory_skew_k=0.5` and `inventory_skew_tick_penalty_max=3`.
- When: `inventory_bias=1.0` for BUY.
- Then: limit price shifts 3 ticks below best ask.
- Pass criteria: exactly 3 tick shift.
- Fail criteria: different tick shift.

AT-934
- Given: `pending_delta` is already reserved and `current_delta` alone is below the limit.
- When: Inventory Skew evaluates a new OPEN intent.
- Then: the gate uses `current + pending` exposure (or runs after reservation) and rejects or tightens as required.
- Pass criteria: decision is based on combined exposure; no dispatch when combined exposure breaches limits.
- Fail criteria: decision uses current-only exposure and allows dispatch.


### **1.4.2.1 PendingExposure Reservation (Anti Over‑Fill)**
**Why:** Without reservation, multiple concurrent signals can all observe the same “free delta” and over‑allocate risk.

**Requirement:** Before dispatching any new `AtomicGroup`, the Soldier must **reserve** the projected exposure impact of the intent, atomically, against a shared budget.

**Where:** `soldier/core/risk/pending_exposure.rs`

**Model (Minimum Viable):**
- Maintain `pending_delta` (and optionally pending vega/gamma) per instrument + global.
- For each candidate group:
  1. Compute `delta_impact_est` from proposal greeks (or worst‑case delta bound).
  2. Attempt `reserve(delta_impact_est)`:
     - If reservation would breach limits → reject the intent with `Rejected(PendingExposureBudgetExceeded)`.
  3. On terminal outcome:
     - Filled → release reservation and convert to realized exposure.
     - Rejected/Canceled/Failed → release reservation.

**Hard Rule:** Reservation must occur **before** any network dispatch; release must be triggered from TLSM terminal transitions.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-225
- Given: 5 concurrent opens with identical pre-trade `current_delta=0`.
- When: PendingExposure reservation runs.
- Then: only the subset that fits the budget reserves; the rest reject; no over-fill occurs.
- Pass criteria: reservations limited to budget; rejected intents do not dispatch.
- Fail criteria: over-fill or reservations exceed budget.

AT-910
- Given: a reservation would breach the exposure budget.
- When: `reserve(delta_impact_est)` is attempted.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(PendingExposureBudgetExceeded)` and no dispatch occurs.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; dispatch count remains 0.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

### **1.4.2.2 Global Exposure Budget (Cross‑Instrument, Correlation‑Aware)**
**Goal:** Prevent “safe per‑instrument” trades from stacking into unsafe portfolio exposure.

**Where:** `soldier/core/risk/exposure_budget.rs`

**Budget Model (Pragmatic MVP):**
- Track exposures per instrument and portfolio aggregate:
  - `delta_usd` (required), `vega_usd` (optional v1), `gamma_usd` (optional v1).
- Portfolio aggregation uses conservative correlation buckets:
  - `corr(BTC,ETH)=0.8`, `corr(BTC,alts)=0.6`, `corr(ETH,alts)=0.6`.
- Gate new opens if portfolio exposure breaches limits even if single‑instrument gates pass.
  - Rejections for portfolio breach MUST use `Rejected(GlobalExposureBudgetExceeded)`.

**Integration Rule:** The Global Budget must be checked using **current + pending** exposure (see §1.4.2.1).

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-226
- Given: BTC and ETH are both near limits.
- When: a new BTC trade passes the local delta gate.
- Then: the trade is rejected if the portfolio budget would breach after correlation adjustment.
- Pass criteria: portfolio-level rejection triggers.
- Fail criteria: trade proceeds despite portfolio breach.

AT-911
- Given: portfolio exposure would breach after correlation adjustment.
- When: Global Exposure Budget evaluates an OPEN intent.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(GlobalExposureBudgetExceeded)` and no dispatch occurs.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; dispatch count remains 0.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

AT-929
- Given: `pending_delta` is already reserved near the limit and `current_delta` is within limits.
- When: Global Exposure Budget evaluates a new OPEN intent.
- Then: the intent is rejected if `current + pending` would breach the portfolio budget.
- Pass criteria: rejection occurs based on combined exposure.
- Fail criteria: intent passes using current-only exposure.

### **1.4.3 Margin Headroom Gate (Liquidation Shield) — MUST implement**

**Why this exists:** Delta-neutral ≠ safe. Deribit can hike maintenance margin; margin liquidation is the silent killer.

**Where:**
- Gate: `soldier/core/risk/margin_gate.rs`
- Fetcher: `soldier/infra/deribit/account_summary.rs`

**Inputs:** `/private/get_account_summary` → `maintenance_margin`, `initial_margin`, `equity`  
**Computed:** `mm_util = maintenance_margin / max(equity, epsilon)`

**Rules (deterministic):**
- If `mm_util` >= `mm_util_reject_opens` (see Appendix A for `mm_util_reject_opens`) → **Reject** any **NEW opens**
- Rejections at `mm_util_reject_opens` MUST use `Rejected(MarginHeadroomRejectOpens)`.
- If `mm_util` >= `mm_util_reduceonly` (see Appendix A for `mm_util_reduceonly`) → PolicyGuard MUST force `TradingMode = ReduceOnly` (block opens; allow close/hedge/cancel)
- If `mm_util` >= `mm_util_kill` (see Appendix A for `mm_util_kill`) → PolicyGuard MUST force `TradingMode = Kill` + trigger deterministic emergency flatten only if eligible per §2.2.3 Kill Mode Semantics (existing §3.1/§1.2 containment applies)

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-227
- Given: `equity=100k`, `maintenance_margin=72k`.
- When: Margin Headroom Gate evaluates a new OPEN.
- Then: the OPEN is rejected.
- Pass criteria: OPEN rejected at gate level.
- Fail criteria: OPEN proceeds.

AT-912
- Given: `mm_util >= mm_util_reject_opens` and `< mm_util_reduceonly`.
- When: Margin Headroom Gate evaluates a new OPEN.
- Then: the OPEN is rejected with `Rejected(MarginHeadroomRejectOpens)`.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; no OPEN dispatch.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

AT-228
- Given: `equity=100k`, `maintenance_margin=90k`.
- When: PolicyGuard computes TradingMode.
- Then: `TradingMode = ReduceOnly`.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly entered; OPEN blocked.
- Fail criteria: TradingMode remains Active.

AT-206
- Given: `mm_util >= mm_util_reject_opens` but below `mm_util_reduceonly`.
- When: a new OPEN intent is evaluated at the Margin Headroom Gate.
- Then: the OPEN intent is rejected; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL intents remain allowed.
- Pass criteria: OPEN rejected at gate level; TradingMode may still be Active (gate rejection is independent of mode).
- Fail criteria: OPEN intent passes the Margin Headroom Gate while `mm_util >= mm_util_reject_opens`.

AT-207
- Given: `mm_util >= mm_util_reduceonly` but below `mm_util_kill`.
- When: PolicyGuard computes TradingMode.
- Then: `TradingMode = ReduceOnly`; OPEN intents blocked; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL allowed.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly entered; opens blocked; closes/hedges allowed.
- Fail criteria: TradingMode is Active while `mm_util >= mm_util_reduceonly`.

AT-208
- Given: `mm_util >= mm_util_kill`.
- When: PolicyGuard computes TradingMode.
- Then: `TradingMode = Kill`; deterministic emergency flatten executes per §3.1/§1.2 containment rules.
- Pass criteria: Kill entered; containment executes (if eligible per §2.2.3); no new orders dispatched except containment.
- Fail criteria: TradingMode is ReduceOnly or Active while `mm_util >= mm_util_kill`.

### **1.4.4 Deribit Order-Type Preflight Guard (Artifact-Backed)**

**Purpose:** Freeze the engine against *verified* Deribit behavior and prevent “market order roulette.”

**Preflight Rules (MUST implement):**

**A) Options (`instrument_kind == option`)**
- Allowed `type`: **`limit` only**
- **Market orders:** forbidden by policy (F-01b)  
  - If `type == market` → **REJECT** with `Rejected(OrderTypeMarketForbidden)` (no rewrite/normalization).
- **Stop orders:** forbidden (F-01a)  
  - Reject any `type in {stop_market, stop_limit}` or any presence of `trigger` / `trigger_price` with `Rejected(OrderTypeStopForbidden)`.
- **Linked/OCO orders:** forbidden (F-08)  
  - Reject any non-null `linked_order_type` with `Rejected(LinkedOrderTypeForbidden)`.
- Execution policy: use **Aggressive IOC Limit** with bounded `limit_price_q` (see §1.4.1).

**B) Futures/Perps (`instrument_kind in {linear_future, inverse_future, perpetual}`)**
- **Allowed `type`:** `limit` (for this bot's execution policy)
- **Market orders:** forbidden by policy  
  - If `type == market` → **REJECT** with `Rejected(OrderTypeMarketForbidden)` (no rewrite/normalization).
- **Stop orders:** **NOT SUPPORTED** for this bot (execution policy is IOC limits only)  
  - Reject any `type in {stop_market, stop_limit}` even if `trigger` is present, with `Rejected(OrderTypeStopForbidden)`.
  - Deribit venue fact (F-09): If stop orders were enabled, venue requires `trigger` to be set.
- **Linked/OCO orders:** forbidden unless explicitly certified (F-08 currently indicates NOT SUPPORTED)  
  - Reject any non-null `linked_order_type` unless `linked_orders_supported == true` **and** feature flag `ENABLE_LINKED_ORDERS_FOR_BOT == true`, with `Rejected(LinkedOrderTypeForbidden)`.

**Linked orders gating variables (contract-bound definitions):**
- `linked_orders_supported` (bool): MUST be `false` for v5.1 (see Deribit Venue Facts Addendum F-08: VERIFIED (NOT SUPPORTED)).
- `ENABLE_LINKED_ORDERS_FOR_BOT` (bool): runtime config feature flag; default `false` (fail-closed if missing/unset).

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-004
- Given: an intent with `linked_order_type` set (non-null).
- When: preflight validation runs with `linked_orders_supported==false` and `ENABLE_LINKED_ORDERS_FOR_BOT==false` (defaults).
- Then: the intent is rejected before any API call.
- Pass criteria: no outbound order is emitted and a deterministic reject reason is logged.
- Fail criteria: any order with non-null `linked_order_type` is dispatched.


**C) Post-only behavior**
- If `post_only == true` and order would cross the book, Deribit rejects (F-06).  
  - Preflight must ensure post-only prices are non-crossing (or disable post_only). If it would cross, reject with `Rejected(PostOnlyWouldCross)`.

**Enforcement points (code):**
- Centralize in a single function called by the trade dispatch path (`private/buy` + `private/sell`) before any API call.
- Violations must be **hard rejects** (do not “try anyway”).

**Regression tests (MUST):**

AT-016
- Given: an options order intent has `order_type == market`.
- When: Deribit Order-Type Preflight Guard runs.
- Then: intent MUST be rejected before dispatch.
- Pass criteria: no dispatch occurs.
- Fail criteria: market order dispatch occurs.

AT-017
- Given: a perpetual order intent has `order_type == market`.
- When: preflight runs.
- Then: intent MUST be rejected before dispatch.
- Pass criteria: no dispatch occurs.
- Fail criteria: market order dispatch occurs.

AT-018
- Given: an options order intent is `stop_market` or stop with market execution.
- When: preflight runs.
- Then: intent MUST be rejected before dispatch.
- Pass criteria: no dispatch occurs.
- Fail criteria: stop-market dispatch occurs.

AT-019
- Given: a perpetual order intent is `stop_market` or stop with market execution.
- When: preflight runs.
- Then: intent MUST be rejected before dispatch.
- Pass criteria: no dispatch occurs.
- Fail criteria: stop-market dispatch occurs.

AT-913
- Given: an intent with `order_type == market`.
- When: preflight validation runs.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(OrderTypeMarketForbidden)`.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; no dispatch occurs.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

AT-914
- Given: an intent with `order_type in {stop_market, stop_limit}`.
- When: preflight validation runs.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(OrderTypeStopForbidden)`.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; no dispatch occurs.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

AT-915
- Given: `linked_order_type` is non-null while linked orders are unsupported.
- When: preflight validation runs.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(LinkedOrderTypeForbidden)`.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; no dispatch occurs.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

AT-916
- Given: `post_only == true` and the limit price would cross the book.
- When: preflight validation runs.
- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(PostOnlyWouldCross)`.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; no dispatch occurs.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

- See AT-004 for linked orders testing (`linked_orders_oco_is_gated_off`).


### **1.5 Position-Aware Execution Sequencer (Council D3)**
**Goal:** Prevent creating *new* naked risk while repairing, hedging, or closing.

**Where:** `soldier/core/execution/sequencer.rs`  
**Input:** `intent_kind(Open|Close|Repair)`, `current_positions`, `desired_legs`, `risk_limits`  
**Output:** An ordered list of **ExecutionSteps** with enforced prerequisites (confirmations).

**Deterministic Sequencing Rules:**
1. **Closing (Reduce-Only):** `Close -> Confirm -> Hedge (reduce-only)`
   - Place reduce-only closes first.
   - Do **not** open hedges until the close step has a terminal confirmation (Filled/Canceled/Failed) and residual exposure is computed.
2. **Opening:** `Open -> Confirm -> Hedge`
   - Place opening legs first (AtomicGroup allowed).
   - Hedge only after opens reach terminal confirmation (Filled/Failed/Canceled) and exposure is measured.
3. **Repairs (Mixed Failed / Zombies):**
   - **Flatten filled legs first** using the §3.1 Emergency Close implementation (`emergency_close_algorithm`).
   - Hedge **only if** flatten retries fail and exposure remains above limit (fallback reduce-only hedge).

**Invariant:**  
- No step may increase exposure while `RiskState != Healthy` or while a prior step is unresolved.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-229
- Given: `RiskState::Degraded`.
- When: an Open intent and a Close/Hedge intent are submitted.
- Then: Open is rejected; Close/Hedge is allowed; no exposure-increasing action occurs while `RiskState != Healthy`.
- Pass criteria: Open blocked; Close/Hedge allowed; exposure not increased.
- Fail criteria: Open allowed or exposure increases while Degraded.

## **2\. State Management: The Panic-Free Soldier**
Profile: CSP

### **2.1 Trade Lifecycle State Machine (TLSM)**

**Requirement**: Never panic. Handle real-world messiness (e.g., receiving a Fill message before the Acknowledgement message).

**Where:** `soldier/core/execution/state.rs`

**States:** `Created -> Sent -> Acked -> PartiallyFilled -> Filled | Canceled | Failed`

**Hard Rules:**
- Never panic on out-of-order WS events.
- “Fill-before-Ack” is valid reality: accept fill, log anomaly, reconcile later.
- Every transition is appended to WAL immediately.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-230
- Given: Fill arrives before Ack.
- When: TLSM processes events.
- Then: final state is Filled, no crash, WAL contains both events.
- Pass criteria: Filled state and WAL contains both events.
- Fail criteria: crash, wrong state, or WAL missing events.


### **2.2 PolicyGuard (Single Authoritative TradingMode Resolver)**
**Goal:** Eliminate conflicting “mode sources” and prevent stale/late policy pushes from re‑enabling risk.

**Where:** `soldier/core/policy/guard.rs`

**Inputs:**
- **Timebase convention:** all `*_ts_ms` values used for staleness/freshness are **monotonic‑epoch milliseconds** (epoch‑aligned, monotonic); `now_ms` is current monotonic‑epoch milliseconds (and `now` refers to `now_ms` in this contract); seconds are derived as `(now_ms - *_ts_ms)/1000`.
- `python_policy` (latest policy payload)
- `python_policy_generated_ts_ms` (monotonic‑epoch ms; timestamp from Commander when policy was computed)
- `watchdog_last_heartbeat_ts_ms` (monotonic‑epoch ms)
- `loop_tick_last_ts_ms` (monotonic‑epoch ms; last completed hot‑loop tick)
- `now_ms` (local monotonic‑epoch milliseconds used for staleness calculations)
- `cortex_override` (effective max-severity across §2.3 producers; see §2.3)

- `f1_cert` (from `artifacts/F1_CERT.json`: `{status, generated_ts_ms, build_id, runtime_config_hash, contract_version}`)
- `fee_model_cache_age_s` (from §4.2)
- `risk_state` (Healthy | Degraded | Maintenance | Kill)
- `enforced_profile` (enum: CSP | GOP | FULL; from runtime config; GOP-only gates apply when `enforced_profile != CSP`)
- `bunker_mode_active` (bool; from §2.3.2 Network Jitter Monitor)
- `evidence_chain_state` (EvidenceChainState; from §2.2.2 EvidenceGuard; required only when `enforced_profile != CSP`)
- `policy_age_sec` (derived: `(now_ms - python_policy_generated_ts_ms) / 1000`)
- `mm_util` (float; maintenance margin utilization; from §1.4.3 Margin Headroom Gate)
- `mm_util_last_update_ts_ms` (monotonic‑epoch ms; freshness timestamp for `mm_util`; see §2.2.1.1 and §7.0)
- `disk_used_pct` (float; ratio in [0,1], where 0.80 means 80% used; from §7.2 Disk Watermarks)
- `disk_used_last_update_ts_ms` (monotonic‑epoch ms; freshness timestamp for `disk_used_pct`; see §2.2.1.1 and §7.0)
- `disk_used_pct_secondary` (float; independent source for corroboration; see §2.2.3.1.2)
- `disk_used_secondary_last_update_ts_ms` (monotonic‑epoch ms; freshness timestamp for `disk_used_pct_secondary`)
- `emergency_reduceonly_active` (bool; true if `POST /api/v1/emergency/reduce_only` is latched/cooldown active)
  - Cooldown semantics: Once set to true via endpoint call, remains true for `emergency_reduceonly_cooldown_s` (default: 300s; see Appendix A) after the endpoint call timestamp.
  - State transition: automatically clears to false after cooldown duration expires AND reconciliation confirms exposure is safe (if reconciliation is required by trigger source).
  - Invariant: While true, PolicyGuard MUST compute `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` (see §2.2.3 Axis Resolver).
- `open_permission_blocked_latch` (bool; from §2.2.4 CP-001)
- `open_permission_reason_codes` (OpenPermissionReasonCode[]; from §2.2.4 CP-001)
- `rate_limit_session_kill_active` (bool; true if 10028/session termination occurred and reconciliation has not cleared)
- `10028_count_5m` (int; rolling 5m count used for session termination corroboration; see §7.0)

#### **2.2.0 PolicyGuard Input Snapshot Coherency (Atomic Snapshot + Memory Order)**
Profile: CSP

**Why this exists (safety-critical):** PolicyGuard consumes inputs produced by multiple concurrent components. A “torn” read (e.g., a fresh timestamp paired with a stale value) can incorrectly compute `TradingMode::Active` and allow an OPEN that should have been blocked.

**Rules (Non-Negotiable):**
1) **Single-snapshot rule:** Each call to `PolicyGuard.get_effective_mode()` MUST acquire exactly one immutable *input snapshot* and MUST compute:
   - axes (§2.2.3.2),
   - TradingMode (§2.2.3.3),
   - `mode_reasons` (§2.2.3.5),
   using only that snapshot. PolicyGuard MUST NOT read mutable live inputs multiple times within the same call.

2) **Atomicity rule:** The snapshot MUST be coherent. It MUST be impossible for a snapshot to contain a mix of “before” and “after” values from any single producer update.
   - At minimum, for every paired field `(X, X_last_update_ts_ms)` the snapshot MUST NOT contain `X_last_update_ts_ms` from an update that is newer than the `X` value in that same snapshot.

3) **Memory order rule:** Publication and consumption of any safety-critical input that can influence TradingMode MUST establish a happens-before relationship:
   - Writers MUST publish with **Release** semantics.
   - PolicyGuard MUST read with **Acquire** semantics.
   - Using **Relaxed** loads/stores for safety-critical publication/consumption is non-compliant.

4) **Fail-closed acquisition:** If a coherent snapshot cannot be acquired (contention, corruption, or any other reason), PolicyGuard MUST fail-closed for that tick:
   - return `TradingMode::ReduceOnly`, and
   - include `REDUCEONLY_INPUT_MISSING_OR_STALE` in `mode_reasons`.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-1054
- Given: a loom-style scheduler (or equivalent systematic interleaving harness) that can interleave a producer update and a `get_effective_mode()` read.
- And: initial state has `mm_util = 0.10` and `mm_util_last_update_ts_ms = now_ms - (mm_util_max_age_ms + 1_000)` (stale).
- And: a producer publishes an update that sets `mm_util = mm_util_reduceonly + 0.001` AND `mm_util_last_update_ts_ms = now_ms` (fresh).
- And: all other gates are forced pass such that:
  - old pair → ReduceOnly via `REDUCEONLY_INPUT_MISSING_OR_STALE`,
  - new pair → ReduceOnly via `REDUCEONLY_MARGIN_MM_UTIL_HIGH`.
- When: TradingMode is computed concurrently with the producer update across all interleavings.
- Then: PolicyGuard MUST NEVER return `TradingMode::Active`.
- Pass criteria: no interleaving yields Active.
- Fail criteria: any interleaving yields Active (indicating a torn snapshot and/or missing Acquire/Release ordering).

#### **2.2.1 Runtime F1 Certification Gate (HARD, runtime enforcement)**
- PolicyGuard MUST read `artifacts/F1_CERT.json`.
- Required schema (minimum keys): `{ status, generated_ts_ms, build_id, runtime_config_hash, contract_version }`.
  - `build_id`: immutable build identifier for the running binary (e.g., git commit SHA).
  - `runtime_config_hash`: `sha256` hex of canonicalized runtime config (see below).
  - `contract_version`: MUST equal the canonical `contract_version` literal in Definitions.
  - `policy_hash_at_cert_time` MAY be included for observability only and MUST NOT be used as a runtime validity gate.
- Freshness window: default 24h (configurable). If missing OR stale OR FAIL => TradingMode MUST be ReduceOnly.
- Binding (Canary hardening): if any of these do not match runtime, F1_CERT MUST be treated as INVALID (ReduceOnly):
  - `F1_CERT.build_id != runtime.build_id`
  - `F1_CERT.runtime_config_hash != runtime.runtime_config_hash`
  - `F1_CERT.contract_version != runtime.contract_version`
- While in ReduceOnly due to F1 invalidity: allow only closes/hedges/cancels; block all opens.
- This rule is strict: no caching last-known-good and no grace periods.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**

AT-020
- Given: F1_CERT.status == PASS but `build_id` OR `runtime_config_hash` OR `contract_version` mismatches runtime.
- When: TradingMode is computed.
- Then: TradingMode MUST be ReduceOnly and OPEN must be blocked.
- Pass criteria: `/status.trading_mode == ReduceOnly` and OPEN does not dispatch.
- Fail criteria: `trading_mode` Active or OPEN dispatch occurs.

AT-021
- Given: F1_CERT was valid previously, then becomes missing OR stale OR FAIL.
- When: TradingMode is computed.
- Then: TradingMode MUST be ReduceOnly (no "last-known-good" bypass).
- Pass criteria: `/status.trading_mode == ReduceOnly` and OPEN does not dispatch.
- Fail criteria: `trading_mode` Active while F1_CERT is missing/stale/FAIL.

AT-012
- Given: F1_CERT has `contract_version="5.2"` and runtime `contract_version` is `"5.2"`.
- When: PolicyGuard validates F1_CERT binding checks.
- Then: `contract_version` comparison passes (no ReduceOnly due to formatting mismatch).
- Pass criteria: TradingMode not forced to ReduceOnly due solely to `contract_version` formatting.
- Fail criteria: ReduceOnly occurs due to "header string vs numeric string" mismatch.

AT-410
- Given: F1_CERT.status == PASS with matching build_id/runtime_config_hash/contract_version, but `policy_hash_at_cert_time` differs from current policy hash.
- When: TradingMode is computed.
- Then: TradingMode is not forced to ReduceOnly due solely to `policy_hash_at_cert_time`.
- Pass criteria: TradingMode remains Active if no other gates are active.
- Fail criteria: ReduceOnly occurs with only `policy_hash_at_cert_time` mismatching.

AT-423
- Given: `artifacts/F1_CERT.json` on disk contains a PASS cert with matching build_id/runtime_config_hash/contract_version.
- When: the file is modified on disk to `status="FAIL"` or deleted, and PolicyGuard computes TradingMode on the next tick.
- Then: TradingMode MUST be ReduceOnly and `/status.f1_cert.status` reflects FAIL or MISSING.
- Pass criteria: `/status.trading_mode == ReduceOnly` within one tick and OPEN does not dispatch.
- Fail criteria: `trading_mode` Active or `/status.f1_cert.status` remains PASS after the file change.

**Acceptance Tests (References):**
- AT-003 in §7.0 validates `/status` F1_CERT fields.


**Canonical hashing rule (non-negotiable):**
- `runtime_config_hash` MUST be computed as `sha256(canonical_json_bytes(config))` where `canonical_json_bytes` means:
  - JSON with **stable key ordering** (sorted recursively),
  - no insignificant whitespace,
  - UTF-8 encoding.

AT-113
- Given: two runtime config JSON inputs that are semantically identical but differ only in key order and whitespace.
- When: `runtime_config_hash` is computed for both.
- Then: both hashes MUST be identical.
- Pass criteria: PolicyGuard does not force ReduceOnly due solely to formatting-only differences.
- Fail criteria: formatting-only changes alter the hash and cause F1 binding mismatch.


#### **2.2.1.1 PolicyGuard Critical Input Freshness (Missing/Stale → Fail-Closed for Opens)**

**Rule (non-negotiable):**
PolicyGuard MUST NOT return `TradingMode::Active` if any critical safety input required for Kill/ReduceOnly decisions is missing or stale.

**Critical inputs (minimum):**
**Critical inputs (definition):** any PolicyGuard input referenced by §2.2.3 axis predicates that is required under the current `enforced_profile`. GOP-only inputs (e.g., `evidence_chain_state`) are critical only when `enforced_profile != CSP`. Missing/unparseable required inputs MUST be treated as missing/stale and force ReduceOnly with `REDUCEONLY_INPUT_MISSING_OR_STALE`.
- `mm_util` (from account summary) must have `mm_util_last_update_ts_ms`
- `disk_used_pct` must have `disk_used_last_update_ts_ms`
- session termination / rate-limit kill flag must be explicit (no "unknown treated as false")

**Freshness defaults (configurable):**
- `mm_util_max_age_ms = 30_000`
- `disk_used_max_age_ms = 30_000`

**Enforcement:**
- If any critical input is missing OR `now_ms - last_update_ts_ms > max_age_ms`:
  - force `TradingMode = ReduceOnly` (block OPEN; allow CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL)
  - set `mode_reasons` to include `REDUCEONLY_INPUT_MISSING_OR_STALE`

**Acceptance test (REQUIRED):**
- Simulate `mm_util_last_update_ts_ms` stale > max age → verify OPEN blocked within one tick; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL still allowed.

AT-001
- Given: `mm_util` is present but `mm_util_last_update_ts_ms` is older than `mm_util_max_age_ms`.
- When: PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode`.
- Then: `TradingMode==ReduceOnly` and `mode_reasons` includes `REDUCEONLY_INPUT_MISSING_OR_STALE`.
- Pass criteria: OPEN intents are blocked within one tick; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL remain allowed.
- Fail criteria: PolicyGuard returns Active or allows any OPEN while critical inputs are stale/missing.

AT-112
- Given: `watchdog_last_heartbeat_ts_ms` is missing or unparseable.
- When: PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode`.
- Then: `TradingMode==ReduceOnly` and `mode_reasons` includes `REDUCEONLY_INPUT_MISSING_OR_STALE`.
- Pass criteria: OPEN does not dispatch.
- Fail criteria: TradingMode Active (or OPEN dispatch) when an axis-resolver input is missing/unparseable.

AT-348
- Given: `rate_limit_session_kill_active` is missing or unparseable.
- When: PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode`.
- Then: `TradingMode==ReduceOnly` and `mode_reasons` includes `REDUCEONLY_INPUT_MISSING_OR_STALE`.
- Pass criteria: OPEN does not dispatch.
- Fail criteria: TradingMode Active (or OPEN dispatch) when the session termination flag is missing/unparseable.

AT-349
- Given: `mm_util` is present but `mm_util_last_update_ts_ms` is missing or unparseable, and all other gates would allow `TradingMode::Active`.
- When: PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode`.
- Then: `TradingMode==ReduceOnly` and `mode_reasons` includes `REDUCEONLY_INPUT_MISSING_OR_STALE`.
- Pass criteria: OPEN does not dispatch.
- Fail criteria: TradingMode Active (or OPEN dispatch) when `mm_util_last_update_ts_ms` is missing/unparseable.

AT-350
- Given: `disk_used_pct` is present but `disk_used_last_update_ts_ms` is missing or unparseable, and all other gates would allow `TradingMode::Active`.
- When: PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode`.
- Then: `TradingMode==ReduceOnly` and `mode_reasons` includes `REDUCEONLY_INPUT_MISSING_OR_STALE`.
- Pass criteria: OPEN does not dispatch.
- Fail criteria: TradingMode Active (or OPEN dispatch) when `disk_used_last_update_ts_ms` is missing/unparseable.

AT-413
- Given: each critical input referenced by §2.2.3 is missing or unparseable one at a time, and all other gates allow `TradingMode::Active`.
- When: PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode`.
- Then: `TradingMode==ReduceOnly` and `mode_reasons` includes `REDUCEONLY_INPUT_MISSING_OR_STALE`.
- Pass criteria: every missing/unparseable input forces ReduceOnly within one tick; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL allowed.
- Fail criteria: any missing/unparseable input yields Active or missing reason code.



#### **2.2.2 EvidenceGuard (No Evidence → No Opens) — HARD RUNTIME INVARIANT**
Profile: GOP

**Profile gating (Normative):**
- EvidenceGuard is a **HARD RUNTIME INVARIANT** only when `enforced_profile != CSP` (i.e., GOP or FULL is enforced).
- When `enforced_profile == CSP`, EvidenceGuard MUST be treated as **NOT_ENFORCED** and MUST NOT:
  - change `TradingMode`,
  - change `OpenPermissionLatch`,
  - or block any CSP-permitted dispatch decision.


**Purpose (TOC constraint relief):** Close the missing enforcement link: if the evidence chain is not green, the system MUST NOT open new risk. “Nice architecture” is meaningless unless it is unbreakable in production.

**Definition (Evidence Chain = required artifacts):**
The following MUST be writable + joinable for every dispatched open-intent:
- WAL intent entry (durable)
- TruthCapsule (with decision_snapshot_id)
- Decision Snapshot payload (L2 top-N at decision time)
- Attribution row for any fill(s) that occur (fees/slippage/net pnl)
  - NOTE: An open-intent that produces zero fills is NOT required to have an attribution row.

**Invariant (Non-Negotiable):**
- If Evidence Chain is not GREEN → **block ALL new OPEN intents**.
- CLOSE / HEDGE / CANCEL intents are allowed only if the cancel/replace is NOT risk-increasing per §2.2.5, and only when not constrained by §2.2.3 Kill semantics (risk-reducing only).
- Risk-increasing CANCEL/REPLACE MUST be rejected while `EvidenceChainState != GREEN` (see §2.2.5 definition).
- When `enforced_profile != CSP`: EvidenceGuard triggers `RiskState::Degraded`; PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` via the canonical axis resolver while `EvidenceChainState != GREEN`, and until GREEN recovers and remains stable for the cooldown window.

**GREEN/RED criteria (minimum):**
EvidenceChainState = GREEN iff ALL are true (rolling window; default `evidenceguard_window_s = 60` seconds, safety-critical; configurable in Appendix A):
- **All required EvidenceGuard counters MUST be defined and parseable** (fail-closed).
  - Missing/unparseable required counter(s) => EvidenceChainState MUST be not GREEN.
  - Required counters (minimum): `truth_capsule_write_errors`, `decision_snapshot_write_errors`, `wal_write_errors`, `parquet_queue_overflow_count`.
- Required counters MUST be fresh: if `now_ms - evidenceguard_counters_last_update_ts_ms` > `evidenceguard_counters_max_age_ms` (default 60000; see Appendix A for `evidenceguard_counters_max_age_ms`), EvidenceChainState MUST be not GREEN and OPEN intents MUST be blocked.
- `wal_write_errors` MUST increment on any failure to satisfy RecordedBeforeDispatch for an OPEN intent, including WAL enqueue failure (bounded queue full) and any persistence/write failure.
- `truth_capsule_write_errors` has not increased within the last `evidenceguard_window_s`
- `decision_snapshot_write_errors` has not increased within the last `evidenceguard_window_s`
- `parquet_queue_overflow_count` not increasing
- `wal_write_errors` has not increased within the last `evidenceguard_window_s`

- `parquet_queue_depth_pct` is defined AND below thresholds (fail-closed if metrics unavailable):
  - Metrics MUST exist: `parquet_queue_depth` (gauge, count), `parquet_queue_capacity` (gauge, count).
  - Derived: `parquet_queue_depth_pct = parquet_queue_depth / max(parquet_queue_capacity, 1)`
  - Trip (breach window): if `parquet_queue_depth_pct > parquet_queue_trip_pct` for >= `parquet_queue_trip_window_s` seconds → EvidenceChainState != GREEN
  - Clear (hysteresis): require `parquet_queue_depth_pct < parquet_queue_clear_pct` for >= `queue_clear_window_s` seconds before GREEN (cleared only after max(queue_clear_window_s, evidenceguard_global_cooldown) with all criteria satisfied)

**Where enforced (must be explicit):**
- When `enforced_profile != CSP`, PolicyGuard `get_effective_mode()` MUST include EvidenceGuard in the axis resolver.
- When `enforced_profile != CSP`, the hot-path execution gate MUST check EvidenceChainState before dispatching OPEN orders.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**

AT-005
- Given: Evidence writers are healthy (WAL + TruthCapsule + Decision Snapshot succeed) and an OPEN intent results in zero fills.
- When: EvidenceGuard evaluates EvidenceChainState over the window.
- Then: EvidenceChainState does not flip to not-GREEN solely due to missing attribution rows.
- Pass criteria: EvidenceChainState can remain GREEN (assuming other writers are healthy).
- Fail criteria: EvidenceGuard blocks opens because an attribution row is absent when no fills occurred.

AT-105
- Given: `evidenceguard_window_s=60` and `truth_capsule_write_errors` increases by 1 at T0 and does not increase afterward.
- When: EvidenceGuard evaluates at `now_ms=T0+59_000` and again at `now_ms=T0+61_000`.
- Then: at +59s EvidenceChainState is not GREEN due to the window; at +61s it may become GREEN only if other criteria + cooldown/hysteresis are satisfied.
- Pass criteria: the 60s window boundary affects GREEN eligibility deterministically.
- Fail criteria: GREEN eligibility ignores the window or uses an unspecified duration.

AT-107
- Given: `wal_write_errors` increments (unable to write intent to WAL).
- When: EvidenceGuard evaluates EvidenceChainState.
- Then: EvidenceChainState MUST be not GREEN (fail-closed); OPEN intents blocked.
- Pass criteria: WAL write failure forces ReduceOnly/blocking of Opens.
- Fail criteria: System remains GREEN despite WAL write failures (fail-open).

AT-414
- Given: an OPEN intent fills and the attribution row is missing or fails to write.
- When: EvidenceGuard evaluates EvidenceChainState.
- Then: EvidenceChainState MUST be not GREEN (fail-closed); OPEN intents blocked.

**Canonical TradingMode computation (axis resolver + staleness + watchdog semantics + reason codes) is defined in §2.2.3 (PolicyGuard-owned).**

#### **2.2.3 TradingMode Computation (Axis Resolver v2 + Reason Codes)**
Profile: CSP

**Hard Rule:** The Soldier never "stores" TradingMode as authoritative state. It recomputes it every loop tick via `PolicyGuard.get_effective_mode()` (the **Axis Resolver**) immediately before any dispatch (§2.2.3.4).

---

##### **2.2.3.0 Axis Model (Normative)**

PolicyGuard SHALL compute TradingMode from three independent health axes:

- `CapitalRiskAxis     ∈ { SAFE, WARNING, CRITICAL }`
- `MarketIntegrityAxis ∈ { STABLE, STRESSED, BROKEN }`
- `SystemIntegrityAxis ∈ { HEALTHY, DEGRADED, FAILING }`

**Axis Computation Rules (Non-Negotiable):**
- **Independence rule:** Each axis MUST depend only on signals assigned to that axis. Axis computation MUST NOT depend on TradingMode, other axes, or derived outcomes.
- **Primary assignment rule:** Every PolicyGuard input signal MUST have exactly one primary axis.
- **Dual-impact rule:** A signal MAY influence a secondary axis only if listed in §2.2.3.1.
- **Authoritative attribution rule:** The axis input lists in §2.2.3.2 are authoritative. A signal MUST NOT influence an axis unless it appears in that axis’s input list, except for secondary-axis influence explicitly allowlisted in §2.2.3.1.

##### **2.2.3.1 Dual-Impact Allowlist (Explicit)**

| Signal | Primary Axis | Secondary Axis | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| WAL write failure | SystemIntegrityAxis | CapitalRiskAxis | Restart/idempotency correctness compromised |
| Ledger corruption | SystemIntegrityAxis | CapitalRiskAxis | Reconciliation correctness compromised |
| Exchange session termination (`rate_limit_session_kill_active`) | SystemIntegrityAxis | CapitalRiskAxis | Containment reliability uncertain |

---

##### **2.2.3.1.2 Kill Trigger Corroboration (Non‑Capital)**

To reduce single‑signal corruption risk, the following **non‑capital** Kill triggers require corroboration.  
If the primary predicate is true but corroboration is missing/false, the trigger MUST NOT contribute to `SystemIntegrityAxis == FAILING`; instead PolicyGuard MUST force **ReduceOnly** with the specified reason code(s).

**Confirmed predicates (Normative):**
- **Watchdog Kill (confirmed):**  
  `(now_ms - watchdog_last_heartbeat_ts_ms > watchdog_kill_s * 1000)` **AND**  
  `(now_ms - loop_tick_last_ts_ms > watchdog_kill_s * 1000)`
- **Disk Kill (confirmed):**  
  `disk_used_pct >= disk_kill_pct` **AND** `disk_used_pct_secondary >= disk_kill_pct`,  
  with both timestamps fresh per `disk_used_max_age_ms`.
- **Session Termination Kill (confirmed):**  
  `rate_limit_session_kill_active == true` **AND** `10028_count_5m >= rate_limit_kill_min_10028`.

**Unconfirmed behavior (Non‑Negotiable):**
- If the primary predicate is true but confirmation fails, PolicyGuard MUST compute `TradingMode = ReduceOnly`
  and include the appropriate `REDUCEONLY_*_UNCONFIRMED` reason code.

**Scope guard:** These corroboration rules do **NOT** apply to capital‑critical Kill triggers (`mm_util >= mm_util_kill`, `risk_state == Kill`).

---

##### **2.2.3.2 Axis Computation (Deterministic)**

PolicyGuard MUST compute the axes as follows, using only the coherent input snapshot acquired per §2.2.0.

**CapitalRiskAxis** (capital exposure / margin headroom)
- Inputs: `mm_util`, `risk_state`, `cortex_override`
- `CRITICAL` if ANY are true:
  - `mm_util >= mm_util_kill` (margin headroom exhausted; §1.4.3)
  - `risk_state == Kill`
  - `cortex_override == ForceKill`
- `WARNING` if:
  - `mm_util >= mm_util_reduceonly` AND `mm_util < mm_util_kill`
- `SAFE` otherwise.

**MarketIntegrityAxis** (market data integrity / comms reliability)
- Input: `bunker_mode_active` (from §2.3.2 Network Jitter Monitor)
- `STRESSED` if `bunker_mode_active == true`
- `STABLE` otherwise.
- `BROKEN` is reserved for future explicit monitors. In v5.2 it MUST NOT be produced by any required subsystem.

**SystemIntegrityAxis** (correctness / containment reliability)
- Inputs: `watchdog_last_heartbeat_ts_ms`, `loop_tick_last_ts_ms`, `disk_used_pct`, `disk_used_pct_secondary`, `rate_limit_session_kill_active`, `10028_count_5m`, plus all reduce-only gates below.
- `FAILING` if ANY are true:
  - Watchdog Kill confirmed (per §2.2.3.1.2)
  - Disk Kill confirmed (per §2.2.3.1.2)
  - Session Termination Kill confirmed (per §2.2.3.1.2)
- `DEGRADED` if ANY are true AND `SystemIntegrityAxis != FAILING`:
  - `risk_state in {Degraded, Maintenance}`
  - `emergency_reduceonly_active == true`
  - `open_permission_blocked_latch == true`
  - `EvidenceChainState != GREEN` (§2.2.2) when `enforced_profile != CSP`
  - F1_CERT invalid/missing/stale/FAIL (§2.2.1)
  - `cortex_override == ForceReduceOnly`
  - `fee_model_cache_age_s > fee_model_hard_stale_s` (§4.2)
  - `policy_age_sec > max_policy_age_sec` (Appendix A: `max_policy_age_sec`)
  - Any critical PolicyGuard input missing/unparseable/stale per §2.2.1.1
  - Watchdog Kill unconfirmed (per §2.2.3.1.2)
  - Disk Kill unconfirmed (per §2.2.3.1.2)
  - Session Termination Kill unconfirmed (per §2.2.3.1.2)
- `HEALTHY` otherwise.

---

##### **2.2.3.3 TradingMode Resolution (Deterministic, Pure Function of Axes)**

TradingMode ∈ { `Active`, `ReduceOnly`, `Kill` } SHALL be computed from axes by the following rules (no other rules are permitted):

1) If `SystemIntegrityAxis == FAILING` OR `CapitalRiskAxis == CRITICAL` → `TradingMode = Kill`
2) Else if `SystemIntegrityAxis == DEGRADED` OR `MarketIntegrityAxis != STABLE` OR `CapitalRiskAxis == WARNING` → `TradingMode = ReduceOnly`
3) Else → `TradingMode = Active`

All 27 axis combinations MUST map deterministically to exactly one TradingMode via these rules.

**Canonical 27-State Mapping Table (Normative):**

This table is the authoritative reference for AT-1048 (enumerability test). Implementations MUST produce identical outputs.

| # | CapitalRiskAxis | MarketIntegrityAxis | SystemIntegrityAxis | TradingMode | Rule |
|---|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|------|
| 1 | SAFE | STABLE | HEALTHY | Active | R3 |
| 2 | SAFE | STABLE | DEGRADED | ReduceOnly | R2 |
| 3 | SAFE | STABLE | FAILING | Kill | R1 |
| 4 | SAFE | STRESSED | HEALTHY | ReduceOnly | R2 |
| 5 | SAFE | STRESSED | DEGRADED | ReduceOnly | R2 |
| 6 | SAFE | STRESSED | FAILING | Kill | R1 |
| 7 | SAFE | BROKEN | HEALTHY | ReduceOnly | R2 |
| 8 | SAFE | BROKEN | DEGRADED | ReduceOnly | R2 |
| 9 | SAFE | BROKEN | FAILING | Kill | R1 |
| 10 | WARNING | STABLE | HEALTHY | ReduceOnly | R2 |
| 11 | WARNING | STABLE | DEGRADED | ReduceOnly | R2 |
| 12 | WARNING | STABLE | FAILING | Kill | R1 |
| 13 | WARNING | STRESSED | HEALTHY | ReduceOnly | R2 |
| 14 | WARNING | STRESSED | DEGRADED | ReduceOnly | R2 |
| 15 | WARNING | STRESSED | FAILING | Kill | R1 |
| 16 | WARNING | BROKEN | HEALTHY | ReduceOnly | R2 |
| 17 | WARNING | BROKEN | DEGRADED | ReduceOnly | R2 |
| 18 | WARNING | BROKEN | FAILING | Kill | R1 |
| 19 | CRITICAL | STABLE | HEALTHY | Kill | R1 |
| 20 | CRITICAL | STABLE | DEGRADED | Kill | R1 |
| 21 | CRITICAL | STABLE | FAILING | Kill | R1 |
| 22 | CRITICAL | STRESSED | HEALTHY | Kill | R1 |
| 23 | CRITICAL | STRESSED | DEGRADED | Kill | R1 |
| 24 | CRITICAL | STRESSED | FAILING | Kill | R1 |
| 25 | CRITICAL | BROKEN | HEALTHY | Kill | R1 |
| 26 | CRITICAL | BROKEN | DEGRADED | Kill | R1 |
| 27 | CRITICAL | BROKEN | FAILING | Kill | R1 |

**State Count Summary:**
- Active: 1 state (row 1 only)
- ReduceOnly: 17 states (rows 2, 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-14, 16-17)
- Kill: 9 states (rows 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18-27)

**Implementation Note:** The resolver function MUST be a pure function with no hidden state. Given the same axis triple, it MUST always produce the same TradingMode.

**Monotonicity Rule (CSP):**
- If any axis worsens between ticks, TradingMode MUST NOT become less restrictive on that tick.

**Recovery Rule (CSP):**
- Axis recovery MUST be slower than axis degradation. Recovery MUST respect the hysteresis/cooldown rules of each producer:
  - EvidenceGuard (§2.2.2) windowing + cooldown (only when `enforced_profile != CSP`)
  - Bunker Mode (§2.3.2) stable-exit window
  - Emergency ReduceOnly (§2.2 inputs) cooldown + reconcile-clear
  - Open Permission Latch (§2.2.4) reconcile-clear

---

##### **2.2.3.4 Dispatch Authorization (Non-Negotiable)**

- Every network dispatch attempt MUST consult PolicyGuard immediately before dispatch (hot path check; §2.2.3.4).
- OPEN intents MUST dispatch only if `TradingMode == Active` AND all other gates allow.
- If `TradingMode == ReduceOnly`: OPEN intents MUST NOT dispatch; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL intents MAY dispatch only if not risk-increasing per §2.2.5.
- If `TradingMode == Kill`: OPEN intents MUST NOT dispatch; ONLY risk-reducing intents MAY dispatch per §2.2.3.6.

---

##### **2.2.3.4.1 Non‑Active OPEN Cancellation (CSP, Non‑Negotiable)**

Whenever `TradingMode != Active`, the engine MUST attempt to cancel all outstanding OPEN orders with `reduce_only != true`.
- This cancel loop MUST be **bounded and non‑blocking** per tick (see `cancel_open_batch_max`, `cancel_open_budget_ms` in Appendix A).
- If any risk‑increasing OPENs remain, the system MUST retry on subsequent ticks until cleared.
- CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL intents remain permitted subject to §2.2.5.

---

##### **2.2.3.5 ModeReasonCode Registry (`/status.mode_reasons`)**

PolicyGuard MUST expose the reasons that produced the current TradingMode via `/api/v1/status.mode_reasons`.

**Hard rules:**
- PolicyGuard MUST compute `mode_reasons` every tick.
- If `TradingMode == Active`: `mode_reasons MUST == []`.
- If `TradingMode == ReduceOnly`: `mode_reasons` MUST be non-empty and MUST contain only `REDUCEONLY_*` reasons.
- If `TradingMode == Kill`: `mode_reasons` MUST be non-empty and MUST contain only `KILL_*` reasons.
- Reasons MUST be deterministically ordered.
- Reasons MUST be tier-pure: `KILL_*` and `REDUCEONLY_*` MUST NOT mix.

**Allowed values (deterministic order):**
Kill-tier:
1. `KILL_WATCHDOG_HEARTBEAT_STALE`
2. `KILL_RISKSTATE_KILL`
3. `KILL_MARGIN_MM_UTIL_CRITICAL`
4. `KILL_RATE_LIMIT_SESSION_TERMINATION`
5. `KILL_DISK_WATERMARK_KILL`
6. `KILL_CORTEX_FORCE_KILL`

ReduceOnly-tier:
1. `REDUCEONLY_RISKSTATE_MAINTENANCE`
2. `REDUCEONLY_EMERGENCY_REDUCEONLY_ACTIVE`
3. `REDUCEONLY_OPEN_PERMISSION_LATCHED`
4. `REDUCEONLY_BUNKER_MODE_ACTIVE`
5. `REDUCEONLY_F1_CERT_INVALID`
6. `REDUCEONLY_EVIDENCE_CHAIN_NOT_GREEN`
7. `REDUCEONLY_CORTEX_FORCE_REDUCE_ONLY`
8. `REDUCEONLY_FEE_MODEL_HARD_STALE`
9. `REDUCEONLY_RISKSTATE_DEGRADED`
10. `REDUCEONLY_POLICY_STALE`
11. `REDUCEONLY_MARGIN_MM_UTIL_HIGH`
12. `REDUCEONLY_INPUT_MISSING_OR_STALE`
13. `REDUCEONLY_WATCHDOG_UNCONFIRMED`
14. `REDUCEONLY_DISK_KILL_UNCONFIRMED`
15. `REDUCEONLY_SESSION_KILL_UNCONFIRMED`

**Reason Derivation Rules (Non-Negotiable):**
- PolicyGuard MUST evaluate all relevant predicates every tick.
- `mode_reasons` MUST include **all** active reasons from the **computed TradingMode tier** for that tick.
- Reasons from non-winning tiers MUST NOT be included (tier purity).

---

##### **2.2.3.6 Kill Semantics (Capital Supremacy Safe, CSP)**

**Kill SHALL mean:**
- No creation of new exposure.
- Only risk-reducing actions are permitted until exposure is neutral.

**Kill MUST NOT mean:**
- “No dispatch of any kind” while exposure exists.

**Capital Supremacy Invariant (Non-Negotiable):**
If net exposure ≠ 0, the system MUST define at least one legal risk-reducing action, regardless of TradingMode.
No state is permitted where:
- exposure ≠ 0, AND
- no CLOSE / HEDGE / emergency flatten action is permitted.

**Kill containment requirement:**
When `TradingMode == Kill` AND net exposure ≠ 0, the system MUST permit and attempt a bounded, deterministic containment sequence:

1) Cancel any risk-increasing OPEN orders (including any non-reduce-only orders).
2) Execute §3.1 Deterministic Emergency Close (reduce-only; bounded attempts).
3) If residual exposure remains above limits after bounded close attempts, place a reduce-only hedge fallback.

Containment actions MUST be:
- **Bounded** (no infinite retries),
- **Deterministic** (same inputs → same actions),
- **Monotonic with respect to exposure** (never increase net exposure; use `reduce_only` / close-only primitives where supported).

Containment MUST be attempted even if:
- `EvidenceChainState != GREEN`,
- WAL is degraded,
- `rate_limit_session_kill_active == true`,
- `disk_used_pct >= disk_kill_pct`,
- `bunker_mode_active == true`,
- or watchdog staleness is the trigger cause.

(If dispatch fails due to transport or venue rejection, that is a runtime outcome; the authorization MUST still allow the attempt.)

**Post-containment hard stop (allowed):**
If `TradingMode == Kill` AND net exposure == 0, the system MAY cease further dispatch and remain halted until the underlying kill trigger clears (or manual intervention), but it MUST continue to publish `/status`.

---

- Fail criteria: Active is computed while evidence is not GREEN.

**Mode Reasons Are Tier-Pure and Deterministically Ordered**
AT-417
- Given: a sequence of ticks where multiple Axis Resolver predicates toggle (including both kill-tier and reduceonly-tier predicates).

- Fail criteria: Kill not computed despite confirmed predicates.

#### **2.2.4 Open Permission Latch (Reconcile-Required, Sticky Until Cleared) — CP-001**
Profile: CSP

**Goal:** Prevent "false-safe opens" after restart, WS gaps, or session termination until reconciliation proves state truth.

**Semantics:**
- If `open_permission_blocked_latch == true`:
  - OPEN intents MUST be blocked.
  - CLOSE / HEDGE / CANCEL intents MUST remain allowed, except risk-increasing cancels/replaces MUST be rejected per §2.2.5.

**State fields:**
- `open_permission_blocked_latch` (bool; `true` means OPEN blocked)
- `open_permission_reason_codes` (`OpenPermissionReasonCode[]`; MUST be `[]` iff `open_permission_blocked_latch == false`)
- `open_permission_requires_reconcile` (bool; MUST equal `open_permission_blocked_latch` for v5.1 - all reason codes are reconcile-class)

**Acceptance Tests (References):**
- AT-027 in §7.0 validates `/status` latch field invariants.

**Deterministic reconstruction (preferred; no persistence):**
- On startup, set `open_permission_blocked_latch = true` with reason `RESTART_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`.
- The latch MUST clear only after reconciliation succeeds.

**Reconciliation success criteria (required):**
- Ledger inflight intents (non-terminal) match exchange open orders by label (all matched within label disambiguation rules per §1.1.2).
- Exchange positions match ledger cumulative fills within `position_reconcile_epsilon` (default: instrument's `min_amount` or `1e-6` if undefined).
- No missing trades over the last `reconcile_trade_lookback_sec` (default: 300s) as determined by REST `/get_user_trades` query.
- All reconcile-class reason codes cleared (no unresolved WS gaps, inventory mismatches, or session termination flags).

**Allowed values (reconcile-only):** `OpenPermissionReasonCode[]`
- `RESTART_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`
- `WS_BOOK_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`
- `WS_TRADES_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`
- `WS_DATA_STALE_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`
- `INVENTORY_MISMATCH_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`
- `SESSION_TERMINATION_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`

**Hard rule:** F1_CERT and EvidenceChain failures MUST NOT appear in `open_permission_reason_codes` (they are cleared by cert/evidence recovery, not reconciliation).

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-010
- Given: `open_permission_blocked_latch==true` with `open_permission_reason_codes` containing `RESTART_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`.
- When: the system evaluates an OPEN intent for dispatch.
- Then: no OPEN order is dispatched; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL intents remain dispatchable, except risk-increasing cancels/replaces are rejected (per §2.2.5), subject to Kill semantics in §2.2.3 in §2.2.3.
- Pass criteria: OPEN dispatch count remains 0; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL dispatch is permitted; risk-increasing cancel/replace is rejected.
- Fail criteria: any OPEN is dispatched while the latch is true.

AT-430
- Given: startup occurs with no persisted latch state.
- When: initialization completes before reconciliation runs.
- Then: `open_permission_blocked_latch == true`, `open_permission_reason_codes` contains `RESTART_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`, and `open_permission_requires_reconcile == true`.
- Pass criteria: latch fields match expected startup values and OPEN remains blocked.
- Fail criteria: latch not set, reason missing, or OPEN allowed before reconciliation.

AT-011
- Given: `open_permission_blocked_latch==true` for a WS gap reason (e.g., `WS_TRADES_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`).
- When: reconciliation succeeds (all criteria in this section are satisfied).
- Then: the latch clears (`open_permission_blocked_latch==false` and `open_permission_reason_codes==[]`), and opens may proceed only if PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode::Active`.
- Pass criteria: latch fields match the invariants immediately after reconciliation; opens remain blocked unless mode is Active.
- Fail criteria: latch clears without reconciliation success, or opens proceed while latch remains true.

AT-402
- Given: `open_permission_blocked_latch==true` with `open_permission_reason_codes` containing `RESTART_RECONCILE_REQUIRED` and a cancel/replace that increases exposure.
- When: cancel/replace permission is evaluated.
- Then: the cancel/replace is rejected until reconciliation clears the latch.
- Pass criteria: risk-increasing cancel blocked while latch is true; allowed only after latch clears and other gates allow.
- Fail criteria: risk-increasing cancel allowed while latch is true.

AT-110
- Given: `open_permission_blocked_latch==true`.
- When: an order placement intent is evaluated with `reduce_only` missing or null.
- Then: it MUST be treated as OPEN and blocked.
- Pass criteria: no order placement is dispatched.
- Fail criteria: any order placement dispatch occurs while `reduce_only` is missing and latch is true.

AT-411
- Given: F1_CERT is missing/stale/FAIL OR (`EvidenceChainState != GREEN` and `enforced_profile != CSP`), and no reconcile-class triggers are active.
- When: `open_permission_reason_codes` are computed.
- Then: `open_permission_reason_codes` does not include F1_CERT or EvidenceChain failures, and `open_permission_blocked_latch` is unchanged.
- Pass criteria: no F1/Evidence codes in reason list; latch not set without a reconcile trigger.
- Fail criteria: any F1/Evidence code appears or latch is set without a reconcile trigger.


#### **2.2.5 Cancel/Replace Permission Rules (Canonical)**

Cancel/Replace intents are allowed only if ALL are true:
1. TradingMode dispatch authorization permits the cancel/replace (§2.2.3); risk-increasing cancel/replace is forbidden when `TradingMode ∈ {ReduceOnly, Kill}`.
2. NOT risk-increasing while `open_permission_blocked_latch == true` (§2.2.4).
3. NOT risk-increasing while `EvidenceChainState != GREEN` when `enforced_profile != CSP` (§2.2.2).
4. NOT risk-increasing while `RiskState == Degraded` (§3.4).
5. Does NOT cancel protective reduce-only closing/hedging orders (§3.2).

**Definition (Risk-Increasing Cancel/Replace):**
- Any cancel/replace that increases absolute net exposure, increases exposure in the current risk direction, or removes `reduce_only` protection on a closing/hedging order.
- Examples: canceling reduce_only close/hedge orders; replacing with larger size in the risk-increasing direction.
Rejections for risk-increasing cancel/replace MUST use `Rejected(RiskIncreasingCancelReplaceForbidden)`.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
Profile: GOP
AT-917
- Given: `EvidenceChainState != GREEN`, `enforced_profile != CSP`, and a risk-increasing cancel/replace.
- When: cancel/replace permission is evaluated.
- Then: the request is rejected with `Rejected(RiskIncreasingCancelReplaceForbidden)`.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; no risk-increasing cancel/replace dispatch occurs.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

Profile: CSP

#### **2.2.6 RejectReasonCode Registry (Intent-Level Rejections)**

**Scope (non-negotiable):** Applies to any intent rejected **before dispatch**. This does **not** replace `ModeReasonCode` or `OpenPermissionReasonCode`.

**MUST:**
- Any intent rejected before dispatch MUST include `reject_reason_code: RejectReasonCode`, and the value MUST be in this registry.
- Any use of `Rejected(...)`, `Rejected(reason=...)`, or `Reject(intent=...)` in this contract implies `reject_reason_code = <TOKEN>` and `<TOKEN> ∈ RejectReasonCode`.

**Completeness rule (non-negotiable):**
- The registry MUST be complete w.r.t. this contract: if a new rejection token is added anywhere, the registry MUST be updated in the same patch.

**Allowed values (minimal complete set):**
- `TooSmallAfterQuantization`
- `InstrumentMetadataMissing`
- `ChurnBreakerActive`
- `LiquidityGateNoL2`
- `EmergencyCloseNoPrice`
- `ExpectedSlippageTooHigh`
- `NetEdgeTooLow`
- `NetEdgeInputMissing`
- `InventorySkew`
- `InventorySkewDeltaLimitMissing`
- `PendingExposureBudgetExceeded`
- `GlobalExposureBudgetExceeded`
- `ContractsAmountMismatch`
- `MarginHeadroomRejectOpens`
- `OrderTypeMarketForbidden`
- `OrderTypeStopForbidden`
- `LinkedOrderTypeForbidden`
- `PostOnlyWouldCross`
- `RiskIncreasingCancelReplaceForbidden`
- `RateLimitBrownout`
- `InstrumentExpiredOrDelisted`
- `FeedbackLoopGuardActive`
- `LabelTooLong`

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-930
- Given: a test harness that triggers at least one rejection in each category (quantization, liquidity, exposure reservation, preflight, cancel/replace permission).
- When: each rejection occurs.
- Then: the response includes `reject_reason_code`, and its value is a member of `RejectReasonCode`.
- Pass criteria: all sampled rejections include a registry value.
- Fail criteria: any rejection has a missing or non-registry reason.


### 2.3 Reflexive Cortex (Hot-Loop Safety Override)

**Where:** `soldier/core/reflex/cortex.rs`

**Inputs:** `MarketData(dvol, spread_bps, depth_topN, last_1m_return)`  
**Output:** `SafetyOverride::{None, ForceReduceOnly{cooldown_s}, ForceKill}`

**Why this exists:** Policy staleness is one problem; volatility shock and microstructure collapse are a different one. The Cortex runs in Rust *inside the hot loop* and can override Python even when Python is “alive” but slow.

**Depth metric definition (non-negotiable):**
- `depth_topN` is USD notional depth computed over the top **N=5** price levels per side: sum `price_i * qty_i` for top-5 bids and top-5 asks.
- Use `min(total_bid_usd, total_ask_usd)` as `depth_topN` (conservative side).

**Cortex override aggregation (effective override):**
- Each §2.3 producer emits a candidate override each tick (currently: Reflexive Cortex and Exchange Health Monitor).
- `cortex_override` is the **effective** override: max severity across all active producers (`ForceKill > ForceReduceOnly > None`).
- PolicyGuard consumes the effective `cortex_override` (no last-write-wins semantics).
- If any producer inputs are missing/unparseable/stale, its candidate MUST be treated as `ForceReduceOnly` (fail-closed).

**Rules (deterministic):**
- If `spread_bps >= spread_kill_bps` for `cortex_kill_window_s` OR `depth_topN <= depth_kill_min` for `cortex_kill_window_s` -> `ForceKill`
- If **DVOL jumps ≥ +10% within ≤ 60s** → `ForceReduceOnly{cooldown_s=dvol_cooldown_s}`
- If `spread_bps > spread_max_bps` **OR** `depth_topN < depth_min` → `ForceReduceOnly{cooldown_s=spread_depth_cooldown_s}`
- ForceKill supersedes ForceReduceOnly if both are triggered in the same tick.

**Behavior when override is active:**
- If `cortex_override == ForceKill`: PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode = Kill` per §2.2.3 Axis Resolver.
- If `cortex_override == ForceReduceOnly`: PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode = ReduceOnly` per §2.2.3 Axis Resolver.
- Cancel **only** non-reduce-only opens; keep closes/hedges alive.

**Definition (Risk-Increasing Cancel/Replace):** see §2.2.5.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-231
- Given: `MarketData` where DVOL jumps by +10% within one minute.
- When: Cortex evaluates `MarketData` and PolicyGuard computes TradingMode.
- Then: opens are blocked and mode flips to `ReduceOnly` within one loop tick.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly entered within one tick; opens blocked.
- Fail criteria: TradingMode remains Active while DVOL jump condition is met.

AT-045
- Given: `spread_bps >= spread_kill_bps` for at least `cortex_kill_window_s` (or `depth_topN <= depth_kill_min` for the same window).
- When: Cortex evaluates `MarketData` and PolicyGuard computes TradingMode.
- Then: `cortex_override == ForceKill`, `TradingMode == Kill`, and `mode_reasons` includes `KILL_CORTEX_FORCE_KILL`.
- Pass criteria: Kill is entered within one tick after the window is satisfied.
- Fail criteria: ForceReduceOnly or Active while kill conditions persist.

AT-418
- Given: Reflexive Cortex would emit `ForceKill` in the same tick that Exchange Health Monitor emits `ForceReduceOnly`.
- When: `cortex_override` is computed and PolicyGuard computes TradingMode.
- Then: `cortex_override == ForceKill` and `TradingMode == Kill`.
- Pass criteria: Kill wins deterministically.
- Fail criteria: ReduceOnly wins or behavior depends on evaluation order.

AT-420
- Given: top-5 bid levels sum to `320_000` USD and top-5 ask levels sum to `280_000` USD (per-level price * qty).
- When: `depth_topN` is computed.
- Then: `depth_topN == 280_000` (min of bid/ask totals).
- Pass criteria: per-level notional used; N=5; conservative side chosen.
- Fail criteria: mid-price valuation, max-side, or different N.

AT-119
- Given: `open_permission_blocked_latch == true` with `open_permission_reason_codes` containing `WS_BOOK_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED` or `WS_TRADES_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`, and a cancel/replace request that increases exposure (e.g., cancel a reduce-only close or replace with larger size in the risk-increasing direction).
- When: the cancel/replace is submitted.
- Then: the cancel/replace is rejected and exposure does not increase.
- Pass criteria: cancel/replace rejected while latch is true; OPEN remains blocked.
- Fail criteria: cancel/replace allowed or exposure increases during the gap.
### **2.3.1 Exchange Health Monitor (Maintenance Mode Override) — MUST implement**

**Why this exists:** You don’t trade into a known exchange outage window. Maintenance is a separate risk state from “Python is alive.”

**Rules:**
- Poll `/public/get_announcements` every **60s**
- If a maintenance window start is ≤ **60 minutes** away:
  - Set `RiskState::Maintenance`
  - This causes PolicyGuard to compute `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` (via `risk_state == Maintenance`; see §2.2.3)
  - Block all **new opens** even if NetEdge is positive
  - Allow closes/hedges (reduce-only)

**Missing/Unreachable Handling (Fail-Closed):**
- If `/public/get_announcements` is unreachable or returns invalid data for `exchange_health_stale_s` (default: 180s; Appendix A):
  - Set `cortex_override = ForceReduceOnly` (producer output; effective override is max-severity per §2.3).
  - Reason: unknown exchange state is not safe for new opens.

**Where:** `soldier/core/risk/exchange_health.rs`

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-232
- Given: `/public/get_announcements` indicates maintenance starting in 30 minutes.
- When: Exchange Health Monitor evaluates announcements.
- Then: opens are blocked and closes allowed.
- Pass criteria: TradingMode ReduceOnly; OPEN blocked; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL allowed.
- Fail criteria: OPEN dispatch occurs or mode remains Active.

AT-204
- Given: `/public/get_announcements` endpoint is unreachable for >= `exchange_health_stale_s`.
- When: Exchange Health Monitor evaluates status.
- Then: `cortex_override = ForceReduceOnly` and OPEN intents are blocked.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly entered; opens blocked.
- Fail criteria: Active mode while announcements are stale/unreachable.


#### **2.3.2 Network Jitter Monitor (Bunker Mode Override)**

**Purpose:** VPS tail latency is a first-class risk driver. If network jitter spikes, “cancel/replace/repair” becomes unreliable, increasing legging tail risk. Bunker Mode reduces exposure by blocking new risk until comms stabilize.

**Inputs (export as metrics):**
- `deribit_http_p95_ms` over last 30s
- `ws_event_lag_ms` (now - last_ws_msg_ts)
- `request_timeout_rate` over last 60s

**Window definition (explicit):** evaluate `deribit_http_p95_ms` once per second over the last 30s rolling window; “3 consecutive windows” means three consecutive evaluations above threshold.

**Rules (Non-Negotiable):**
- If `deribit_http_p95_ms > 750ms` for 3 consecutive windows OR `ws_event_lag_ms > bunker_jitter_threshold_ms` OR `request_timeout_rate > 2%`:
  - Set `bunker_mode_active = true` (PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode::ReduceOnly`; see §2.2.3)
  - Block OPEN intents
  - Allow CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL
- Exit Bunker Mode only after all metrics are below thresholds for a stable period `bunker_exit_stable_s` (default 120s; Appendix A).

**Missing Metrics Handling (Fail-Closed):**
- If any required metric (`deribit_http_p95_ms`, `ws_event_lag_ms`, `request_timeout_rate`) is missing or uncomputable:
  - Set `bunker_mode_active = true`
  - Reason: unknown network state is not safe for new opens.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-267
- Given: `ws_event_lag_ms` breaches the threshold.
- When: Network Jitter Monitor evaluates bunker mode.
- Then: OPEN intents are blocked; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL allowed.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly enforced; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL allowed.
- Fail criteria: OPEN allowed or ReduceOnly not enforced.

AT-268
- Given: bunker entry conditions clear and metrics stay below thresholds.
- When: the stable period elapses.
- Then: the system remains ReduceOnly during cooldown and returns to normal after the full `bunker_exit_stable_s`.
- Pass criteria: exit only after full stable period.
- Fail criteria: exit early or no recovery.

AT-209
- Given: `ws_event_lag_ms > bunker_jitter_threshold_ms` (or any other bunker entry condition from §2.3.2 rules).
- When: Network Jitter Monitor evaluates bunker mode.
- Then: `bunker_mode_active = true`, PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode = ReduceOnly`, OPEN intents are blocked, CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL allowed only as permitted by §2.2.5.
- Pass criteria: Bunker Mode entered; opens blocked; closes/hedges allowed.
- Fail criteria: TradingMode is Active while bunker entry conditions are met.

AT-401
- Given: `bunker_mode_active == true` and a cancel/replace that increases exposure (e.g., cancel a reduce-only close).
- When: cancel/replace permission is evaluated.
- Then: the cancel/replace is rejected; non-risk-increasing cancels may proceed.
- Pass criteria: risk-increasing cancel rejected while bunker mode is active; OPEN remains blocked.
- Fail criteria: risk-increasing cancel allowed during bunker mode.

AT-345
- Given: `deribit_http_p95_ms > 750ms` for three consecutive evaluations of the 30s rolling window and no other bunker entry condition is true.
- When: Network Jitter Monitor evaluates bunker mode on each evaluation tick.
- Then: Bunker Mode enters on the third consecutive breach and blocks OPEN intents.
- Pass criteria: entry occurs only after three consecutive breaches; a non-breach resets the count.
- Fail criteria: entry occurs early or ignores the consecutive requirement.

AT-115
- Given: Bunker Mode entered due to `ws_event_lag_ms` above threshold.
- When: all bunker metrics remain below thresholds continuously for `bunker_exit_stable_s`.
- Then: TradingMode may exit ReduceOnly only after the full stable period elapses.
- Pass criteria: exit timing equals `bunker_exit_stable_s`.
- Fail criteria: exit occurs earlier or uses an unspecified duration.

AT-205
- Given: `ws_event_lag_ms` metric is missing/uncomputable (e.g., no WS messages received yet).
- When: Network Jitter Monitor evaluates bunker mode.
- Then: `bunker_mode_active = true` and OPEN intents are blocked.
- Pass criteria: Bunker Mode entered; opens blocked.
- Fail criteria: Active mode while required metrics are missing.

### **2.3.3 Mark/Index/Last Basis Monitor (Liquidation Reality Guard)**

**Purpose:** Liquidation/margin risk is driven by reference prices (e.g., mark), not necessarily last trade. Large basis
divergence is a microstructure failure mode; the bot MUST fail-closed for new risk when basis blows out.

**Where:** `soldier/core/risk/basis_monitor.rs`

**Inputs (per instrument, minimum):**
- `mark_price` (float, >0) + `mark_price_ts_ms`
- `index_price` (float, >0) + `index_price_ts_ms`
- `last_price` OR `mid_price` (float, >0) + `last_price_ts_ms`
- `now_ms`

**Derived metrics:**
- `basis_mark_last_bps = abs(mark_price - last_price) / mark_price * 10_000`
- `basis_mark_index_bps = abs(mark_price - index_price) / mark_price * 10_000`
- `basis_is_fresh = max(now_ms - mark_price_ts_ms, now_ms - index_price_ts_ms, now_ms - last_price_ts_ms) <= basis_price_max_age_ms`

**Fail-closed missing/stale handling:**
- If any required price is missing/unparseable OR `basis_is_fresh == false`:
  - emit `ForceReduceOnly{cooldown_s=basis_reduceonly_cooldown_s}` (producer output) until fresh data recovers.

**Trip rules (deterministic):**
- If `max(basis_mark_last_bps, basis_mark_index_bps) >= basis_kill_bps` for `basis_kill_window_s`:
  - emit `ForceKill`
- Else if `max(...) >= basis_reduceonly_bps` for `basis_reduceonly_window_s`:
  - emit `ForceReduceOnly{cooldown_s=basis_reduceonly_cooldown_s}`

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-951
- Given: `basis_reduceonly_bps=50`, `basis_reduceonly_window_s=5`, and basis exceeds 50 bps for >=5s.
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates Basis Monitor reduce-only trip).
- When: Basis Monitor evaluates and PolicyGuard computes TradingMode.
- Then: `cortex_override==ForceReduceOnly{cooldown_s=basis_reduceonly_cooldown_s}` and OPENs are blocked.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly enforced; cooldown uses basis-specific cooldown param.
- Fail criteria: no ReduceOnly OR cooldown uses unrelated parameters.

AT-952
- Given: `basis_kill_bps=150`, `basis_kill_window_s=5`, and basis exceeds 150 bps for >=5s.
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates Basis Monitor kill trip).
- When: Basis Monitor evaluates and PolicyGuard computes TradingMode.
- Then: `cortex_override==ForceKill` and TradingMode enters Kill.
- Pass criteria: Kill enforced within one tick after window.
- Fail criteria: Kill not enforced.

AT-954
- Given: required basis price inputs are missing or stale (age > `basis_price_max_age_ms`).
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates Basis Monitor stale-input fail-closed).
- When: Basis Monitor evaluates.
- Then: it emits ForceReduceOnly (fail-closed) and OPENs are blocked.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly enforced due solely to missing/stale basis inputs.
- Fail criteria: Active mode while basis inputs are missing/stale.

AT-963
- Given:
  - `basis_reduceonly_bps=50`, `basis_kill_bps=150`
  - mark/index/last are present and fresh (`basis_is_fresh == true`)
  - `max(basis_mark_last_bps, basis_mark_index_bps) < 50 bps` continuously for >= `basis_reduceonly_window_s`
  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates the Basis Monitor)
- When: Basis Monitor evaluates and PolicyGuard computes TradingMode for an OPEN intent.
- Then: Basis Monitor MUST NOT emit `ForceReduceOnly` or `ForceKill`; no basis-driven override is present; the OPEN proceeds to dispatch.
- Pass criteria: dispatch count becomes 1 and there is no basis-driven override.
- Fail criteria: ReduceOnly/Kill (or OPEN blocked) attributable to Basis Monitor despite basis being within threshold and inputs fresh.


### **2.4 Durable Intent Ledger (WAL Truth Source)**
Profile: CSP

**Council Weakness Covered:** TLSM duplication \+ messy middle \+ restart correctness. **Requirement:** Redis is not a source of truth. All intents \+ state transitions must be persisted to a crash-safe local WAL (Sled or SQLite). **Where:** `soldier/infra/store/ledger.rs` **Rules:**

* Write intent record BEFORE network dispatch.  
* Write every TLSM transition immediately (append-only).  
* On startup, replay ledger into in-memory state and reconcile with exchange.

**Persistence levels (latency-aware):**
- **RecordedBeforeDispatch:** intent is recorded (e.g., in-memory WAL buffer) before dispatch.
- **DurableBeforeDispatch:** durability barrier reached (fsync marker or equivalent) before dispatch.

**Dispatch rule:** RecordedBeforeDispatch is **mandatory**. DurableBeforeDispatch is required when the
durability barrier is configured/required by the subsystem.

#### **2.4.1 WAL Writer Isolation (Hot Loop Protection)**

- The hot loop MUST NOT block on WAL disk I/O.
- WAL appends MUST go through a bounded in-memory queue; `RecordedBeforeDispatch` means the enqueue succeeds.
- If the WAL queue is full or enqueue fails, the system MUST fail-closed for OPEN intents (block OPENs / ReduceOnly) and MUST continue ticking.
- An enqueue failure MUST increment `wal_write_errors` (treated as a WAL write failure for EvidenceGuard).
- The system MUST expose WAL queue telemetry in `/status`:
  - `wal_queue_depth` (current items in the WAL queue)
  - `wal_queue_capacity` (max items in the WAL queue)
  - `wal_queue_enqueue_failures` (monotonic counter of failed enqueues)

**Hot-loop output queue backpressure (Non-Negotiable):**
- All hot-loop output queues (status writer, telemetry, order events) MUST be bounded.
- If any such queue is full, the hot loop MUST NOT block and MUST force ReduceOnly until backlog clears.

**Persisted Record (Minimum):**
- intent_hash, group_id, leg_idx, instrument, side, qty, limit_price
- tls_state, created_ts, sent_ts, ack_ts, last_fill_ts
- exchange_order_id (if known), last_trade_id (if known)

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-233
- Given: a crash occurs after send, before ACK.
- When: the system restarts.
- Then: it must NOT resend; it must reconcile and proceed.
- Pass criteria: no duplicate send; reconcile succeeds.
- Fail criteria: resend occurs or reconcile missing.

AT-234
- Given: a crash occurs after fill, before local update.
- When: the system restarts.
- Then: it detects fill from exchange trades and updates TLSM + triggers sequencer.
- Pass criteria: fill detected; TLSM updated; sequencer triggered.
- Fail criteria: fill missed or TLSM not updated.

AT-935
- Given: a crash occurs after RecordedBeforeDispatch succeeds (WAL intent record durable), but before any network send attempt, so `sent_ts` is absent and the exchange has no open order for the intent's `s4:` label.
- When: the system restarts (twice), and on each restart it replays WAL and completes reconciliation (label/open-order + trade reconciliation) before attempting dispatch.
- Then: on the first restart, it must dispatch the intent **exactly once**, record `sent_ts`, and proceed; on the second restart, it must NOT dispatch again (since WAL no longer indicates "unsent").
- Pass criteria: across two restarts, total dispatch count == 1; `sent_ts` becomes non-null after restart #1; restart #2 performs reconcile and produces 0 dispatches for that intent.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs before reconciliation completes, dispatch count == 0 despite "unsent + reconciled + dispatch permitted," or dispatch count > 1 across restarts.

AT-940
- Given: a crash occurs after the exchange ACK is received for an intent, but before local TLSM/WAL updates record `ack_ts` or advance state.
- When: the system restarts and replays WAL, then reconciles open orders and trades before any dispatch.
- Then: it must recover the ACKed state from reconciliation, record `ack_ts`, and must NOT resend the intent.
- Pass criteria: TLSM advances to Acked (or Filled if trades indicate) and `ack_ts` is recorded; no duplicate send.
- Fail criteria: resend occurs, `ack_ts` remains missing despite evidence, or TLSM remains inflight after reconciliation.

AT-906
- Given: WAL appends use a bounded queue of capacity N, and the WAL writer is stalled so the queue reaches N items.
- When: an OPEN intent is evaluated and the system attempts RecordedBeforeDispatch enqueue.
- Then: the OPEN intent is rejected before dispatch, `wal_write_errors` increments, and the hot loop continues ticking.
- Pass criteria: no outbound dispatch for that OPEN; `wal_write_errors` increases; opens remain blocked until enqueue succeeds.
- Fail criteria: hot loop blocks, an OPEN dispatch occurs without a successful enqueue, `wal_write_errors` does not increment, or opens remain allowed while enqueue fails.

Profile: GOP
AT-969
- Given: WAL appends use a bounded queue of capacity N, the WAL writer is stalled so the queue reaches N items, and `enforced_profile != CSP`.
- When: EvidenceGuard evaluates EvidenceChainState for that tick/window.
- Then: EvidenceChainState is not GREEN while enqueue fails and OPEN intents remain blocked.
- Pass criteria: EvidenceChainState != GREEN within the EvidenceGuard window; opens remain blocked until enqueue succeeds.
- Fail criteria: EvidenceChainState remains GREEN or opens remain allowed while enqueue fails.

Profile: CSP

AT-925
- Given: a hot-loop output queue (status writer, telemetry, or order events) reaches capacity N.
- When: the hot loop attempts to enqueue another item.
- Then: the hot loop does not block and TradingMode is forced to ReduceOnly until the queue depth falls below N.
- Pass criteria: no stall; queue depth <= N; ReduceOnly enforced.
- Fail criteria: hot loop blocks or remains Active under backpressure.


**Trade-ID Idempotency Registry (Ghost-Race Hardening) — MUST implement:**
- Persist a set/table: `processed_trade_ids`
- Record mapping: `trade_id -> {group_id, leg_idx, ts, qty, price}`

**WS Fill Handler rule (idempotent):**
1) On trade/fill event: if `trade_id` already in WAL → **NOOP**
2) Else: append `trade_id` to WAL **first**, then apply TLSM/positions/attribution updates.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-269
- Given: order fills during WS disconnect.
- When: on reconnect, Sweeper runs before WS replay.
- Then: Sweeper finds trade via REST → updates ledger; later WS trade arrives → ignored due to `processed_trade_ids`.
- Pass criteria: REST update occurs; WS replay is ignored as duplicate.
- Fail criteria: duplicate processing or missing ledger update.

AT-270
- Given: duplicate WS trade event.
- When: handler processes the duplicate.
- Then: the second event is ignored.
- Pass criteria: duplicate is a NOOP.
- Fail criteria: duplicate is processed.

## **3\. Safety & Recovery**
Profile: CSP

### **3.1 Deterministic Emergency Close**

**Requirement**: When an atomic group fails, we must exit the position *immediately* and *safely*.

**Where:** `soldier/core/execution/emergency_close.rs`

**Price Source (Deterministic, fail-closed):**
- Primary: `L2BookSnapshot` best bid/ask when present and fresh (age <= `l2_book_snapshot_max_age_ms`; Appendix A).
- Fallback: `L1TickerSnapshot` best bid/ask (REST/WS ticker) when present and fresh (age <= `l2_book_snapshot_max_age_ms`; Appendix A).
- The `best` price in step 1 uses the selected source (asks for buy, bids for sell).
- If no valid source (missing/unparseable/stale or inverted bid/ask), emergency close MUST NOT dispatch and MUST return `Rejected(EmergencyCloseNoPrice)` and log `EmergencyCloseNoPrice`.

**Algorithm (Deterministic, 3 tries):**
1. Attempt **IOC limit close** at best ± `close_buffer_ticks` (default 5 ticks; see Appendix A for `close_buffer_ticks`).
2. If partial fill: repeat for remaining qty (max 3 loops, exponential buffer: multiply by 2 each retry → 10 ticks, 20 ticks).
3. If still exposed after retries: submit **reduce-only perp hedge** to neutralize delta (bounded size).
4. Log `AtomicNakedEvent` with group_id + exposure + time-to-delta-neutral.

**AtomicNakedEvent schema (minimum):**
- `group_id` (UUIDv4)
- `strategy_id` (string)
- `incident_ts_ms` (epoch ms)
- `exposure_usd_before` (float)
- `exposure_usd_after` (float)
- `time_to_delta_neutral_ms` (integer)
- `close_attempts` (integer; 1-3)
- `hedge_used` (bool)
- `cause` (string; non-empty; recommended values: `atomic_legging_failure|emergency_close_exhausted|hedge_fallback`)
- `trading_mode_at_event` (`Active|ReduceOnly|Kill`)
- `evidence_chain_state_at_event` (EvidenceChainState; e.g., `GREEN|RED`; required only when `enforced_profile != CSP`)

AT-211
- Given: an atomic group enters mixed state (one leg filled, another rejected or none) and emergency close runs.
- When: emergency close completes (including optional hedge fallback).
- Then: exactly one AtomicNakedEvent is emitted with required schema fields present and `time_to_delta_neutral_ms` computed.
- Pass criteria: event exists with required fields, is joinable to `group_id`, and if `enforced_profile != CSP`, `evidence_chain_state_at_event` is present.
- Fail criteria: missing event or missing required fields.

Profile: GOP
AT-213
- Given: an atomic group enters mixed state (one leg filled, another rejected or none), `enforced_profile != CSP`, and emergency close runs.
- When: AtomicNakedEvent is recorded.
- Then: the event includes `strategy_id`, `cause`, `trading_mode_at_event`, and `evidence_chain_state_at_event` with valid values.
- Pass criteria: each field is present; `cause` is non-empty; `trading_mode_at_event` is one of `Active|ReduceOnly|Kill`; `evidence_chain_state_at_event` matches EvidenceChainState enum values.
- Fail criteria: any required field missing or invalid.

Profile: CSP
**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-235
- Given: one leg filled and the book thins.
- When: emergency close runs.
- Then: close attempts run and fallback hedge executes if still exposed; exposure goes to ~0.
- Pass criteria: bounded close attempts then hedge fallback if needed; exposure neutralized.
- Fail criteria: no close attempts or exposure remains.

AT-236
- Given: Liquidity Gate reject conditions are present.
- When: emergency close runs.
- Then: emergency close still submits IOC close attempts (Liquidity Gate does NOT block it).
- Pass criteria: IOC close attempts are submitted.
- Fail criteria: emergency close blocked by Liquidity Gate.

AT-937
- Given: `L2BookSnapshot` is missing/unparseable/stale and a fresh `L1TickerSnapshot` is available.
- When: emergency close runs.
- Then: IOC close attempts are submitted using the L1 best bid/ask as the `best` price.
- Pass criteria: dispatch occurs and uses the L1 ticker as the price source.
- Fail criteria: dispatch is blocked despite a valid L1 ticker or uses a stale/invalid source.

AT-938
- Given: `L2BookSnapshot` is missing/unparseable/stale and no fresh `L1TickerSnapshot` is available.
- When: emergency close runs.
- Then: no dispatch occurs and the attempt is rejected with `Rejected(EmergencyCloseNoPrice)`.
- Pass criteria: dispatch count remains 0 and the rejection reason is recorded.
- Fail criteria: any dispatch occurs or rejection reason is missing/mismatched.


### **3.2 Smart Watchdog**

**Goal:** Watchdog must not cancel hedges/closing orders.

**Protocol:**
- Watchdog triggers on silence > 5s → calls `POST /api/v1/emergency/reduce_only`.

**Soldier behavior on reduce_only:**
1. Ensure `emergency_reduceonly_active == true` so PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` immediately.
2. Cancel orders where `reduce_only == false`.
3. KEEP all reduce-only closing/hedging orders alive.
4. If exposure breaches limit: submit emergency reduce-only hedge.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-237
- Given: a network hiccup mid-hedge.
- When: Watchdog triggers reduce-only.
- Then: the hedge stays alive.
- Pass criteria: reduce-only hedge remains live.
- Fail criteria: hedge is canceled.

AT-203
- Given: `emergency_reduceonly_active == true` and there exists (a) an open order with `reduce_only == false` and (b) a closing/hedging order with `reduce_only == true`.
- When: Watchdog reduce-only behavior runs.
- Then: (a) is canceled and (b) is NOT canceled.
- Pass criteria: only `reduce_only == false` orders are canceled; reduce-only close/hedge orders remain live.
- Fail criteria: any reduce-only close/hedge order is canceled, or any non-reduce-only order remains live.




### **3.3 Local Rate Limit Circuit Breaker (Deribit Credits + 429/10028 Survival)**

**Council Weakness Covered:** Rate Limit Exhaustion (Medium) + Session Termination (High).

**Where:** `soldier/infra/api/rate_limit.rs`

**Deribit Reality (MUST implement):**
- Deribit uses a **credit-based / tiered** limit system. Limits are **dynamic per account/subaccount**.
- When credits are depleted, Deribit can respond with `too_many_requests` (`code 10028`) and **terminate the session**.

**Limit Source of Truth (Runtime):**
- On startup and periodically (e.g., every 60s), call `/private/get_account_summary` and read the `limits.matching_engine` groups (rate + burst per group).
- Update the local limiter parameters at runtime:
  - `tokens_per_sec = rate`
  - `burst = burst`
- Keep conservative defaults if the endpoint is unavailable.
- **Repeated fetch failure rule:** If limits fetch fails `limits_fetch_failures_trip_count` times within `limits_fetch_failure_window_s` seconds, set `RiskState::Degraded`.
- **Config (Appendix A):** `limits_fetch_failures_trip_count = 3` (default), `limits_fetch_failure_window_s = 300` (default).

AT-106
- Given: `limits_fetch_failures_trip_count=3` and `limits_fetch_failure_window_s=300`.
- When: three consecutive `/private/get_account_summary` limit reads fail within 300s.
- Then: `RiskState==Degraded` and opens are blocked via ReduceOnly.
- Pass criteria: the third failure within window deterministically trips Degraded.
- Fail criteria: Degraded does not trip, or trips without meeting the threshold.

AT-133
- Given: `limits_fetch_failures_trip_count=3` and `limits_fetch_failure_window_s=300`.
- When: three `/private/get_account_summary` limit reads fail, but no three failures occur within any rolling 300s window (e.g., failures at `T0`, `T0+200s`, `T0+400s`).
- Then: `RiskState` MUST NOT become `Degraded` due solely to these failures.
- Pass criteria: Degraded does not trip unless 3 failures fall within the configured window.
- Fail criteria: Degraded trips when the threshold is not met within the window.

**Limiter Model (Local):**
- Token bucket (parameterized by the account’s current credits/rate), not hardcoded.
- **Priority Queue (Preemption):** emergency_close, reduce-only hedges, and cancels preempt data refresh tasks.

**Brownout Controller (Pressure Shedding — MUST implement):**
- Classify every request into one of: `EMERGENCY_CLOSE`, `CANCEL`, `HEDGE`, `OPEN`, `DATA`.
- Under limiter pressure OR a 429 burst:
  - shed `DATA` first (skip noncritical refreshes)
  - block `OPEN` next (treat as ReduceOnly)
  - preserve `CANCEL`/`HEDGE`/`EMERGENCY_CLOSE`
  - OPEN rejections under brownout MUST use `Rejected(RateLimitBrownout)`.
- On `too_many_requests` / `code 10028` (session termination):
  1. Set `rate_limit_session_kill_active = true`
  2. PolicyGuard MUST compute `TradingMode::Kill` within one tick
  3. Set Open Permission Latch reason: `SESSION_TERMINATION_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`
  4. Reconnect/backoff and run full reconcile before any trading resumes

**Hard Rules:**
1. If bucket empty: wait required time (async sleep). Never panic.
2. On observed 429: enter `RiskState::Degraded`, slow loops automatically, and reduce non-critical traffic.
3. On `too_many_requests` / `code 10028` OR "session terminated":
   - Set `rate_limit_session_kill_active = true`
   - PolicyGuard computes `TradingMode::Kill` immediately (no opens, no replaces)
   - Set Open Permission Latch reason: `SESSION_TERMINATION_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`
   - Exponential backoff, then **reconnect**
   - Run **3-way reconciliation** (orders + trades + positions + ledger)
   - Resume only when stable (`RiskState::Healthy`) and latch cleared

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-238
- Given: token bucket configured at `T tokens/sec` and `burst=B`.
- When: 100 mixed requests (data refresh + hedges + cancels) are fired.
- Then: aggregate throughput never exceeds `T`/`B`, and hedges/cancels preempt data refresh under contention.
- Pass criteria: rate limits enforced; priority preemption holds.
- Fail criteria: throughput exceeds limits or data refresh preempts hedges/cancels.

AT-239
- Given: token bucket exhausted by `DATA` requests.
- When: `OPEN`, `CANCEL`, `HEDGE`, `EMERGENCY_CLOSE` are submitted.
- Then: `DATA` is shed first; `OPEN` is blocked; `CANCEL`/`HEDGE`/`EMERGENCY_CLOSE` continue to be serviced.
- Pass criteria: data shed; open blocked; critical intents processed.
- Fail criteria: opens serviced or critical intents blocked while data continues.

AT-919
- Given: limiter pressure (or a 429 burst) and an OPEN intent.
- When: brownout shedding applies.
- Then: the OPEN is rejected with `Rejected(RateLimitBrownout)`.
- Pass criteria: rejection reason matches; no OPEN dispatch.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or reason missing/mismatched.

AT-240
- Given: API returns `too_many_requests` (`code 10028`) mid-run.
- When: rate limit handling evaluates.
- Then: `OPEN` blocked immediately; `TradingMode = Kill` + Degraded immediately; reconnect with backoff → full reconcile → resume only after stable.
- Pass criteria: Kill entered and reconcile path executed before resuming.
- Fail criteria: opens proceed or reconnect/reconcile not enforced.

### **3.4 Continuous 3-Way Reconciliation (Partials \+ WS Gaps \+ Zombies)**

**Council Weakness Covered:** Missing TLSM lifecycle handling \+ messy middle (partials, sequence gaps, zombie states). **Authoritative Sources (in order):**

1. Exchange Trades/Fills (truth of what executed)  
2. Exchange Orders (truth of what is open)  
3. Exchange Positions (truth of exposure)  
4. Local Ledger (intent/state history)

**WS Continuity & Gap Handling (Channel-Specific, Deterministic) — MUST implement:**

> **Non-negotiable principle:** There is **no single global WS sequence** you can trust across all streams. Continuity rules are **per channel**, and recovery always flows through **REST snapshots + reconciliation**.

**A) Order Book feeds (`book.*`) — changeId/prevChangeId continuity (per instrument):**
- Track `last_change_id[instrument]`.
- On each incremental event:
  - If `prevChangeId == last_change_id[instrument]`: accept; set `last_change_id = changeId`.
  - Else (mismatch/gap):
    1) Set `RiskState::Degraded` and **pause opens**.
       - MUST set `open_permission_blocked_latch = true` with reason `WS_BOOK_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`.
    2) **Resubscribe** to the book channel for that instrument.
    3) Fetch a **full REST snapshot** for the instrument and rebuild the book.
    4) Run reconciliation, then only resume trading when `RiskState::Healthy`.

**B) Trades feeds (`trades.*`) — trade_seq continuity (per instrument):**
- Track `last_trade_seq[instrument]`.
- On each trade:
  - If `trade_seq == last_trade_seq + 1` (or strictly increasing where the feed batches): accept; update.
  - Else (gap or non-monotonic):
    1) Set `RiskState::Degraded` and **pause opens**.
       - MUST set `open_permission_blocked_latch = true` with reason `WS_TRADES_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`.
    2) Pull recent trades via REST for that instrument and reconcile to the ledger.
    3) Resume only when reconciliation confirms no missing fills.

**C) Private orders/positions/portfolio streams — no “global monotonic seq”:**
- Do **not** invent a `last_seq` for private state.
- Use:
  - **heartbeat / ping** to detect liveness
  - WS disconnect / session termination detection
- On disconnect OR session-level errors:
  1) Set `RiskState::Degraded` and **pause opens**.
     - MUST set `open_permission_blocked_latch = true` with reason `SESSION_TERMINATION_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`.
  2) Force REST snapshot reconciliation (open orders + positions + recent trades).
  3) Resume only after reconciliation passes.

#### **3.4.D** Application-Level WS Data Liveness (Zombie Socket Detection) — MUST implement:
- **Key rule:** TCP/WS ping/pong or heartbeats are not sufficient evidence of market-data liveness.
- Track `last_marketdata_event_ts_ms`: updated ONLY on application market-data payloads (book/trades/ticker), excluding heartbeat/ping/test frames.
- Compute `ws_marketdata_event_lag_ms = now_ms - last_marketdata_event_ts_ms`.

**Trip condition (stalled feed; gated to avoid illiquid false-trips):**
Trip `WS_DATA_STALE_RECONCILE_REQUIRED` only if BOTH are true:
1) `ws_marketdata_event_lag_ms > ws_zombie_silence_ms`, AND
2) (EITHER)
   - `has_open_exposure == true` (any open position OR any in-flight/open orders), OR
   - `had_recent_marketdata_activity == true` where `had_recent_marketdata_activity := (now_ms - last_marketdata_event_ts_ms) <= ws_zombie_activity_window_ms` evaluated at the last time the feed was known-good.

**On trip (deterministic corrective actions):**
1) Set `RiskState::Degraded` and pause opens.
2) Set Open Permission Latch reason: `WS_DATA_STALE_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`.
3) Force WS reconnect/resubscribe.
4) Fetch REST snapshots (orders + positions + recent trades) and run reconciliation.
5) Resume only when reconciliation succeeds and latch clears.

**Explicit exclusion (avoid false-trip loops):**
- This Zombie Socket rule is based on *market-data event silence* (`ws_marketdata_event_lag_ms`) and MUST NOT trip solely
  because an individual instrument’s book `change_id` fails to advance.
- If ticker/trades (or any other marketdata payload) are still arriving such that `ws_marketdata_event_lag_ms` is within
  threshold, the system MUST NOT set `WS_DATA_STALE_RECONCILE_REQUIRED` (no global reconnect loop).
- Per-instrument book quietness is handled by existing L2 staleness + Liquidity Gate and/or per-channel resubscribe logic;
  it is not a “zombie socket” unless market-data as a whole has stalled.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-946
- Given: an illiquid instrument’s book `change_id` does not advance for > `ws_zombie_silence_ms`, but ticker (or trades)
  payloads for any subscribed market-data channel continue to arrive such that `ws_marketdata_event_lag_ms <= ws_zombie_silence_ms`.
  `has_open_exposure == true`.
  - All other gates are configured to pass; no unrelated Open Permission Latch reasons are set (test isolates Zombie Socket rule).
- When: WS liveness monitor evaluates.
- Then: it MUST NOT set `WS_DATA_STALE_RECONCILE_REQUIRED` (no global reconnect loop); the monitor remains non-tripped.
- Pass criteria: latch not set by this rule.
- Fail criteria: latch set or Degraded loops triggered solely by per-instrument book stagnation while other marketdata is live.

AT-947
- Given: `ws_marketdata_event_lag_ms > ws_zombie_silence_ms` and `has_open_exposure == true`, while WS ping/pong continues.
  - All other gates are configured to pass; no unrelated Open Permission Latch reasons are set (test isolates Zombie Socket rule).
- When: WS liveness monitor evaluates.
- Then: `RiskState::Degraded` and Open Permission Latch sets `WS_DATA_STALE_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`; opens are blocked until reconcile clears.
- Pass criteria: latch set; OPEN blocked; reconnect + reconcile path invoked.
- Fail criteria: OPEN allowed or latch not set.

AT-948
- Given: an illiquid instrument with no marketdata events for > `ws_zombie_silence_ms`, but `has_open_exposure == false` and `had_recent_marketdata_activity == false`.
  - All other gates are configured to pass; no unrelated Open Permission Latch reasons are set (test isolates Zombie Socket rule).
- When: WS liveness monitor evaluates.
- Then: it MUST NOT set `WS_DATA_STALE_RECONCILE_REQUIRED` (no reconnect loop from legitimate quiet markets).
- Pass criteria: latch not set by this rule.
- Fail criteria: latch set or Degraded loops triggered solely by quiet book.

**Safety rule during Degraded:** allow reduce-only closes/hedges to proceed; block any risk-increasing cancels/replaces/opens (see definition in §2.2.5).

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-271
- Given: an incremental book update where `prevChangeId != last_changeId`.
- When: WS continuity handling runs.
- Then: immediate Degraded → resubscribe + full snapshot rebuild → opens remain paused until rebuild completes.
- Pass criteria: Degraded entered; resubscribe + rebuild executed; opens paused.
- Fail criteria: no Degraded or opens resume before rebuild completes.

AT-408
- Given: an incremental book update where `prevChangeId != last_changeId`.
- When: WS continuity handling runs.
- Then: `open_permission_blocked_latch == true` and `open_permission_reason_codes` includes `WS_BOOK_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`.
- Pass criteria: latch true; reason code present; OPEN blocked.
- Fail criteria: latch false, reason code missing, or OPEN dispatch occurs.

AT-272
- Given: trades feed where `trade_seq` jumps (gap) for an instrument.
- When: WS continuity handling runs.
- Then: Degraded → REST trade pull + reconcile → no duplicate processing; only then resume.
- Pass criteria: Degraded entered; REST reconcile runs; no duplicate processing.
- Fail criteria: no reconcile or duplicates processed.

AT-120
- Given: RiskState is Degraded due to a WS continuity break.
- When: a cancel/replace that increases exposure is attempted.
- Then: the request is rejected; reduce-only closes/hedges remain allowed.
- Pass criteria: cancel/replace rejected while Degraded; reduce-only close/hedge allowed.
- Fail criteria: risk-increasing cancel/replace is allowed during Degraded.

AT-202
- Given: a WS trades stream gap is detected (trade_seq non-monotonic).
- When: the system evaluates permissions for an OPEN intent.
- Then: OPEN is blocked and `/status.open_permission_reason_codes` includes `WS_TRADES_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`.
- Pass criteria: OPEN blocked; reason code present; latch sticky until reconciliation clears.
- Fail criteria: OPEN allowed or reason code absent.

AT-409
- Given: a private WS session termination or disconnect is detected (e.g., 10028/session termination).
- When: session termination handling runs.
- Then: `open_permission_blocked_latch == true` and `open_permission_reason_codes` includes `SESSION_TERMINATION_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`.
- Pass criteria: latch true; reason code present; OPEN blocked until reconciliation clears.
- Fail criteria: latch false, reason code missing, or OPEN allowed before reconciliation.

AT-941
- Given: a crash occurs during reconciliation (WS reconnect and REST snapshot in progress) while RiskState is Degraded and the open-permission latch is set.
- When: the system restarts and replays WAL.
- Then: it must re-run reconciliation idempotently, keep opens blocked until reconciliation passes, and avoid duplicate dispatch.
- Pass criteria: Degraded/latch persists until reconcile succeeds; no dispatch before reconciliation completes; no duplicate processing.
- Fail criteria: opens proceed before reconciliation completes or duplicate dispatch/processing occurs.


**Triggers:**
- startup
- timer every 5–10s
- WS gap event
- orphan fill event (fill/trade seen with no local Sent/Ack)

**CorrectiveActions (must enumerate):**
- CancelStaleOrder(order_id)
- ReplaceIOC(intent_hash, new_limit_price)
- EmergencyFlattenGroup(group_id)
- ReduceOnlyDeltaHedge(target_delta=0, max_size=cap)

AT-210
- Given: local TLSM state is Sent (or equivalent inflight), but exchange trades show Filled and ACK is missing.
- When: the system processes the orphan fill via REST/WS reconciliation.
- Then: TLSM transitions to Filled (panic-free), no duplicate order is created, and the sequencer executes close/hedge as required.
- Pass criteria: correct terminal TLSM state and no duplicate dispatch.
- Fail criteria: panic, duplicate dispatch, or incorrect final state.


 **Mixed-State Rule:**  
* If AtomicGroup has mixed leg outcomes (filled \+ rejected/none), issue immediate flatten NOW (runtime) and also during startup reconciliation.

### **3.5 Zombie Sweeper (Ghost Orders & Forgotten Intents)**

**Cadence:** Every 10s (independent of WS)  
**Inputs (authoritative):** `REST get_open_orders`, `REST get_user_trades`, `ledger inflight intents`

**Corrective rules (deterministic):**
- If an exchange open order has label `s4:` but **no matching ledger intent** → `CancelStaleOrder` + log `GhostOrderCanceled`.
- Before marking `Sent|Acked` as `Failed` due to “no open order”:
  1) Query `get_user_trades` filtered by `{label_prefix=s4:, instrument, last N minutes}`
  2) If a trade exists → transition TLSM to `Filled|PartiallyFilled` accordingly (panic-free), update WAL, and run sequencer as needed.
  3) Only if **no open order AND no trade** → mark `Failed` and unblock sequencer.
- If open order age `> stale_order_sec` and `reduce_only == false`:
  - cancel
  - optionally replace **only if** `RiskState == Healthy` (never replace while Degraded).

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-121
- Given: an order fills during WS disconnect and the Sweeper runs before WS replay.
- When: the Sweeper queries REST trades for the label/instrument.
- Then: ledger updates to Filled/PartiallyFilled and later WS trade is ignored via `processed_trade_ids`.
- Pass criteria: no duplicate trade processing; TLSM state updated from REST trade.
- Fail criteria: duplicate fills or missing TLSM update.

AT-122
- Given: an exchange open order has label `s4:` and no matching ledger intent.
- When: the Sweeper runs.
- Then: `CancelStaleOrder` is issued and `GhostOrderCanceled` is logged.
- Pass criteria: cancel dispatch occurs and the log entry is written.
- Fail criteria: ghost order remains open or no log entry is produced.

AT-123
- Given: a Sent/Acked order has no open order and no trade in the REST lookback.
- When: the Sweeper runs.
- Then: TLSM state is marked `Failed` and the sequencer is unblocked.
- Pass criteria: `Failed` state recorded and sequencer resumes.
- Fail criteria: state remains inflight or sequencer remains blocked.

AT-124
- Given: open order age `> stale_order_sec`, `reduce_only == false`, and `RiskState == Degraded`.
- When: the Sweeper runs.
- Then: the order is canceled and not replaced.
- Pass criteria: cancel issued; no `ReplaceIOC` emitted while Degraded.
- Fail criteria: any `ReplaceIOC` occurs while Degraded.


## **4\. Quantitative Logic: The "Truth" Engine**

### **4.1 SVI Stability Gates**

**Gate 0 (Liquidity-Aware Thresholds):**
SVI behavior must adapt to liquidity conditions. If `depth_topN < depth_min` (same metric used by Liquidity Gate / Cortex):
- Drift threshold: **20% → 40%**
- RMSE gate: **0.05 → 0.08**
Still enforce **SVI Math Guard** and **Arb-Guards** (those do NOT loosen).

**Gate 1 (RMSE):**
- If `rmse > rmse_max` → reject calibration.
- Where `rmse_max = 0.05` (healthy depth) or `0.08` (low depth per Gate 0).

**Gate 2 (Parameter Drift):**
- If params move > `drift_max` vs last valid fit in one tick → reject new fit and hold previous params.
- Where `drift_max = 0.20` (healthy depth) or `0.40` (low depth per Gate 0).
**Action:** set `RiskState::Degraded` if drift exceeds threshold `svi_guard_trip_count` times within `svi_guard_trip_window_s` (defaults from Appendix A).

**SVI Math Guard (Hard NaN / Blow-Up Shield):**
- If any fitted parameter is non-finite (`NaN` / `Inf`) → return `None` and hold last valid fit.
- If any derived implied vol is non-finite OR exceeds **500%** (`iv > 5.0`) → return `None`.
- On any guard trip: increment `svi_guard_trips`; if count exceeds `svi_guard_trip_count` within `svi_guard_trip_window_s` (defaults from Appendix A) → set `RiskState::Degraded`.

#### **4.1.1 SVI Arb-Guards (No-Arb Validity)**

**Why this exists:** RMSE/drift gates can pass while the curve is financially nonsense. We must reject **arbitrageable** surfaces.

**Where:** `soldier/core/quant/svi_arb.rs` (invoked from `validate_svi_fit(...)`)

**Guards (minimum viable):**
- **Butterfly convexity:** across a grid of strikes, call prices must be convex in strike  
  (second difference ≥ `-ε`).
- **Calendar monotonicity:** total variance should be non-decreasing with maturity for the same `k`  
  (allow small inversion ≤ `ε`).
- **No negative densities:** implied density proxy ≥ 0 across grid (within tolerance).

**Action:**
- If any arb-guard fails → invalidate fit, hold last valid, increment `svi_arb_guard_trips`.
- If count exceeds `svi_guard_trip_count` within `svi_guard_trip_window_s` (defaults from Appendix A) → `RiskState::Degraded` and **pause opens**.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-241
- Given: a deliberately wavy fit that passes RMSE but violates convexity.
- When: arb-guards validate the fit.
- Then: the fit is rejected and the previous fit is held.
- Pass criteria: fit rejected; last valid retained.
- Fail criteria: invalid fit accepted.

#### **4.1.2 Liquidity-Aware Acceptance (Avoid Stale-Fit Paralysis)**

**Rule:**
- In low depth (`depth_topN < depth_min`), accept fits with `drift <= 30%` and `rmse <= 0.07` **as long as Arb-Guards pass**.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-242
- Given: low depth snapshot with `drift=30%` and `rmse=0.07`.
- When: SVI fit is evaluated.
- Then: the fit is accepted if arb-guards pass, and rejected if arb-guards fail.
- Pass criteria: accept with arb-pass; reject with arb-fail.
- Fail criteria: reject despite arb-pass or accept despite arb-fail.

### **4.2 Fee-Aware Execution**

**Dynamic Fee Model:**
- Fee depends on instrument type (option/perp), maker/taker, and delivery proximity.
- `fee_usd = Σ(leg.notional_usd * (fee_rate + delivery_buffer))`

**Implementation:** `soldier/core/strategy/fees.rs`
- Provide `estimate_fees(legs, is_maker, is_near_expiry) -> fee_usd`

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-243
- Given: gross edge smaller than fees.
- When: fee-aware execution evaluates a trade.
- Then: the trade is rejected.
- Pass criteria: rejection occurs.
- Fail criteria: trade proceeds.

**Fee Cache Staleness (Fail-Closed):**
- Poll fee model (via `/private/get_account_summary` for tier/rates) every 60s.
- Track `fee_model_cache_age_s` (derived from epoch ms timestamp).
- Timestamp requirement: `fee_model_cached_at_ts` MUST be epoch milliseconds (not monotonic ms) to ensure staleness is computed correctly across restarts and between components.
- If `fee_model_cached_at_ts` is missing or unparseable, treat the fee cache as hard-stale (`RiskState::Degraded`) and PolicyGuard MUST force `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` until refresh succeeds.
- Soft stale (age > `fee_cache_soft_s`, default 300s; see Appendix A): apply conservative fee buffer using `fee_stale_buffer` (default 0.20): `fee_rate_effective = fee_rate * (1 + fee_stale_buffer)`.
- Hard stale (age > `fee_cache_hard_s`, default 900s; see Appendix A): set `RiskState::Degraded` and PolicyGuard MUST force `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` until refresh succeeds.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-244
- Given: fresh fee cache (age <= `fee_cache_soft_s`).
- When: fee estimates are computed.
- Then: estimates use actual rates.
- Pass criteria: no stale buffer applied.
- Fail criteria: stale buffer applied while cache is fresh.

AT-245
- Given: hard-stale fee cache (age > `fee_cache_hard_s`).
- When: PolicyGuard computes TradingMode and intents are evaluated.
- Then: `RiskState==Degraded` and opens are blocked; mode becomes ReduceOnly.
- Pass criteria: RiskState Degraded; ReduceOnly enforced; OPEN blocked.
- Fail criteria: RiskState not Degraded, OPEN allowed, or mode remains Active.

AT-031
- Given: `fee_model_cached_at_ts == T0` (epoch ms) and process restarts before any fee refresh; `now_ms == T0 + (fee_cache_hard_s*1000) + 1`.
- When: `fee_model_cache_age_s` is computed after restart and PolicyGuard computes TradingMode.
- Then: `fee_model_cache_age_s > fee_cache_hard_s` and PolicyGuard forces `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` (OPEN blocked) until refresh succeeds.
- Pass criteria: age is computed from epoch timestamps across restart (no monotonic reset underflow).
- Fail criteria: age resets/underflows and PolicyGuard remains Active while cache is hard-stale.

AT-042
- Given: `fee_model_cached_at_ts` is missing or unparseable.
- When: PolicyGuard computes TradingMode.
- Then: `RiskState==Degraded`, `TradingMode==ReduceOnly`, and OPEN intents are rejected before dispatch.
- Pass criteria: RiskState Degraded; no OPEN dispatch; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL allowed unless Kill.
- Fail criteria: RiskState not Degraded, `TradingMode==Active`, or any OPEN dispatch occurs.

AT-032
- Given:
  - `fee_cache_soft_s` is configured.
  - `fee_cache_hard_s` is configured and `fee_cache_hard_s > fee_cache_soft_s`.
  - `fee_stale_buffer` is configured (default 0.20).
  - `fee_model_cache_age_s = fee_cache_soft_s + 1` and `fee_model_cache_age_s <= fee_cache_hard_s`.
  - A candidate OPEN intent that would otherwise pass NetEdge with the fresh fee rate.
- When:
  - The system evaluates the OPEN intent through the fee-aware execution gates.
- Then:
  - The fee estimate uses an effective fee rate buffered by `fee_stale_buffer`.
- Pass criteria:
  - The computed fee estimate reflects the configured buffer in the soft-stale window.
- Fail criteria:
  - The fee estimate is unbuffered in the soft-stale window OR applies the buffer outside the soft-stale window.

AT-033
- Given:
  - `fee_cache_hard_s` is configured.
  - `fee_model_cache_age_s = fee_cache_hard_s + 1`.
- When:
  - PolicyGuard computes TradingMode and the system attempts to dispatch an OPEN intent.
- Then:
  - `TradingMode = ReduceOnly` and the OPEN intent is rejected.
- Pass criteria:
  - No OPEN intent is dispatched while hard-stale fee data persists.
- Fail criteria:
  - Any OPEN intent is dispatched while hard-stale fee data persists.


- Update fee tier / maker-taker rates used by:
  - §1.4.1 Net Edge Gate (fees component)
  - §1.4 Pricer (fee-aware edge checks)

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-246
- Given: fee tier changes.
- When: the next polling cycle completes.
- Then: NetEdge computation reflects the new tier.
- Pass criteria: updated fee tier applied within one cycle.
- Fail criteria: NetEdge remains based on old tier.


### **4.3 Trade Attribution Schema (Realized Friction Truth)**

**Council Weakness Covered:** Self-improving open loop \+ time handling / drift. **Where:** `soldier/core/analytics/attribution.rs` **Requirement:** Every trade must log projected edge vs realized execution friction with timestamps to measure drift. **Key Fields:** `exchange_ts`, `local_send_ts`, `local_recv_ts`, `drift_ms = local_recv_ts - exchange_ts`. **Rules:**

* If `drift_ms` exceeds `time_drift_threshold_ms` (default: **50ms**, configurable), the system MUST set `RiskState::Degraded` and PolicyGuard MUST compute `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` via the canonical `risk_state == Degraded` trigger (see §2.2.3).
* Require **chrony/NTP** running as an operational prerequisite.
* Time drift monitoring is a RiskState input; PolicyGuard enforces the mode consequence via its canonical axis resolver.
* **Alignment**: Default aligns with §8.1 Time Drift gate (p99_clock_drift ≤ 50ms).

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-273
- Given: `drift_ms > time_drift_threshold_ms`.
- When: time drift gate evaluates.
- Then: opens are blocked (ReduceOnly) until drift is restored.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly enforced while drift persists.
- Fail criteria: opens allowed during drift violation.

AT-108
- Given: `drift_ms > time_drift_threshold_ms`.
- When: PolicyGuard computes TradingMode with RiskState reflecting the drift violation.
- Then: `trading_mode==ReduceOnly` and `mode_reasons` includes `REDUCEONLY_RISKSTATE_DEGRADED`.
- Pass criteria: OPEN blocked until drift restored.
- Fail criteria: `trading_mode` Active while drift violation persists.


**Parquet Row (Minimum):**
- group_id, leg_idx, strategy_id
- truth_capsule_id
- fair_price_at_signal, limit_price_sent, fill_price
- slippage_bps (fill vs fair), fee_usd, gross_edge_usd, net_edge_usd
- exchange_ts, local_send_ts, local_recv_ts, drift_ms, rtt_ms



### **4.3.1 PnL Decomposition Fields (Theta/Delta/Vega/Fee Drag)**
Profile: GOP

**Why this exists:** Execution friction tells you *how* you traded (slippage/fees/time drift). Decomposition tells you *why* you made or lost money (edge vs luck vs costs).

**Add Parquet fields (minimum viable):**
- `delta_pnl_usd`, `theta_pnl_usd`, `vega_pnl_usd`, `gamma_pnl_usd` (optional)
- `fee_drag_usd`, `residual_pnl_usd`
- `spot_at_signal`, `spot_at_fill`, `iv_at_signal`, `iv_at_fill`, `dt_seconds`
- **Greeks (raw as provided by exchange) + normalized:**
  - `delta_raw`, `theta_raw`, `vega_raw` at signal (and at fill if available)
  - `theta_per_day`, `vega_per_1pct` (normalized interpretations used by our math)
  - `dt_days`, `dIV_pct` (inputs to the PnL approximation)

**Greek Units (MUST define and enforce):**
- `theta_per_day`: theta is treated as **per day**, so `theta_pnl = theta_per_day * dt_days`.
- `vega_per_1pct`: vega is treated as **per 1% IV change**, so `vega_pnl = vega_per_1pct * dIV_pct`.
- Always store:
  1) **raw greeks** as returned by Deribit
  2) **normalized greeks** you used in the calculation  
  This prevents “unit drift” bugs and lets you re-run attribution later.

**Note:** For very short DTE, theta semantics can be quirky; record both raw + normalized and let analytics handle edge cases.

**Python implementation:** `python/analytics/pnl_attribution.py`

**Compute (first-order approximations):**
- `dt_days = dt_seconds / 86400.0`
- `dIV_pct = (IV_fill - IV_signal) * 100.0`  (if IV is stored as fraction)
- `delta_pnl ≈ delta_raw * (S_fill - S_signal)`
- `theta_pnl ≈ theta_per_day * dt_days`
- `vega_pnl ≈ vega_per_1pct * dIV_pct`
- `fee_drag = fee_usd`
- `residual = realized_pnl - (delta_pnl + theta_pnl + vega_pnl + gamma_pnl) - fee_usd - slippage_cost`

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-247
- Given: `S_fill == S_signal` and `IV_fill == IV_signal`.
- When: PnL decomposition runs.
- Then: `delta_pnl≈0` and `vega_pnl≈0`; residual must not explode.
- Pass criteria: delta/vega near zero; residual bounded.
- Fail criteria: large delta/vega or residual blow-up.

AT-248
- Given: `theta_per_day = -0.04` and `dt_seconds = 43200` (12h).
- When: theta PnL is computed.
- Then: `theta_pnl ≈ -0.02` (all else equal).
- Pass criteria: theta PnL matches expectation within tolerance.
- Fail criteria: theta PnL deviates materially.


### **4.3.2 Truth Capsule (Decision Context Logger) — MUST implement**
Profile: GOP

**Goal:** Make every *realized* outcome explainable by the *inputs + gates + model state* that produced the order.
Without this, optimization is open-loop and you will “improve” the wrong knobs.

**Write timing (hard rule):**
- TruthCapsule MUST be recorded **before first dispatch** of any leg in an AtomicGroup (RecordedBeforeDispatch).
- TruthCapsule durability to long-term storage (e.g., Parquet / remote object store) MAY be asynchronous by default.
- When `enforced_profile != CSP`, the Evidence Commit Barrier below is REQUIRED before any risk-increasing dispatch.
- If TruthCapsule recording fails → block opens and enter `RiskState::Degraded` (ReduceOnly).

#### Evidence Commit Barrier (Normative)

When `enforced_profile != CSP`, TruthCapsule and Decision Snapshot writes MUST satisfy a commit barrier before any network dispatch occurs.

Definitions:
- `EvidenceCommitted(truth_capsule_id, decision_snapshot_id)`: Evidence is COMMITTED iff both artifacts are retrievable by ID from the local evidence store immediately after the write returns success.
- COMMITTED MUST NOT mean: ID allocated; enqueued in an in-memory-only queue; best-effort write scheduled.
- `EvidenceCommitBarrier`: the dispatch path MUST NOT issue any outbound network request that can create or increase exposure (OPEN / replace-as-open) until `EvidenceCommitted(...) == true`.

Failure semantics:
- If EvidenceCommitBarrier cannot be satisfied for a decision that would dispatch:
  - dispatch MUST be blocked (fail-closed).
  - the system MUST enter `RiskState::Degraded`.
  - OPEN intents MUST be blocked until EvidenceCommitted can be satisfied.
  - CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL intents remain governed by TradingMode/Kill semantics.

AT-046
- Given: `enforced_profile != CSP`, an AtomicGroup has at least one leg eligible for dispatch, `truth_capsule_id` and `decision_snapshot_id` are allocated, and `EvidenceCommitted(truth_capsule_id, decision_snapshot_id) == false`.
- When: the system attempts the first dispatch of any leg in that AtomicGroup.
- Then: dispatch MUST be blocked (no outbound order sent) and the system MUST enter a fail-closed state (`RiskState::Degraded` and `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` via canonical triggers).
- Pass criteria: no first-dispatch occurs without EvidenceCommitted; opens remain blocked until logging is healthy.
- Fail criteria: any order is dispatched before EvidenceCommitted == true.

AT-1046
- Given: `enforced_profile != CSP`, Evidence writer is healthy, and evidence commit returns success only after a simulated delay `D`.
- When: the system evaluates an OPEN decision that would dispatch.
- Then: Evidence commit MUST be invoked first, no outbound dispatch occurs before EvidenceCommitted == true, and exactly one outbound dispatch occurs after EvidenceCommitted == true.
- Pass criteria: ordering is proven by timestamps or event ordering in the decision log.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs before commit, or commit never happens and dispatch still occurs.

AT-1047
- Given: `enforced_profile != CSP`, evidence writer fails after ID allocation (commit returns error).
- When: an OPEN decision would dispatch.
- Then: dispatch MUST NOT occur, `RiskState::Degraded` MUST be entered, and OPENs MUST remain blocked until evidence commits succeed again.
- Pass criteria: dispatch_count == 0; Degraded asserted; OPEN blocked.
- Fail criteria: dispatch occurs or system remains Active for OPENs.

**Parquet Writer Isolation (Hot Loop Protection) + Fail‑Closed on Writer Errors:**
- Hot loop MUST enqueue TruthCapsule writes to a **bounded queue**; a dedicated writer thread/process drains and batches writes.
- Hot loop MUST NOT stall on disk I/O.
- If the queue overflows OR writer errors occur:
  - increment `parquet_write_errors` / `truth_capsule_write_errors`
  - enter `RiskState::Degraded` (ReduceOnly) until healthy.

**Identity:**
- `truth_capsule_id` = UUIDv4
- Keyed by: `group_id`, `intent_hash` (per-leg), `policy_hash`, `strategy_id`

**Storage:**
- Append-only Parquet table: `truth_capsules.parquet` (or JSONL if Parquet not ready), partitioned by `date` + `exchange`.
- Trade attribution rows add `truth_capsule_id` (foreign key).

**TruthCapsule fields (minimum viable):**
**Decision Snapshot (Decision-time L2 top‑N) — REQUIRED for replay validity:**
- Define “Decision Snapshot” as a compact L2 top‑N snapshot captured at decision time.
- Persist Decision Snapshots in an append-only store (partitioned by date or hour; storage format implementation-defined).
- On every trade decision that results in dispatch, the system MUST persist the Decision Snapshot and write `decision_snapshot_id` into the Truth Capsule / decision record.
- If Decision Snapshot persistence fails → treat as a TruthCapsule logging failure: block opens and enter `RiskState::Degraded` (ReduceOnly).
- If heavy tick/L2 stream archives are paused due to disk watermarks, Decision Snapshots MUST still be recorded (they are small and required).

- `truth_capsule_id`, `group_id`, `leg_idx`, `intent_hash`, `strategy_id`, `policy_hash`
- **Snapshot references:**
  - `decision_snapshot_id` (decision-time L2 top‑N; REQUIRED). This is the canonical field; `l2_snapshot_id` is legacy and MUST NOT be emitted in v5.1 outputs.
  - `snapshot_bundle_id` (optional: richer bundle if present)
  - `exchange_ts`, `local_ts`, `drift_ms`
- **Model state references:**
  - `svi_fit_id` (or `svi_params_hash`)
  - `svi_params` (a,b,rho,m,sigma) OR store hash + pointer
  - `greeks_source` = `deribit|svi|hybrid`
- **Pricing + edge components (the “why”):**
  - `fair_price_at_signal` (must match §4.3)
  - `gross_edge_usd_est`, `fee_usd_est`, `net_edge_usd_est`
  - `edge_components_json` (e.g., vrp/skew/regime terms if used)
- **Execution plan (the “how”):**
- `order_style` = `post_only|ioc_limit`
  - `limit_price_sent`, `max_requotes`, `rescue_ioc_max`, `order_age_cancel_ms`
- **Friction predictions (the “expected pain”):**
  - `predicted_slippage_bps_sim`, `predicted_slippage_usd_sim`
  - `predicted_fill_prob` (if modeled)
  - `spread_bps_at_signal`, `depth_topN_at_signal`
- **Gate decisions (the “permissioning”):**
  - `liquidity_gate_pass`, `net_edge_gate_pass`, `inventory_gate_pass`, `time_drift_gate_pass`
  - `gate_reject_reason` (enum/string)

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-249
- Given: an order is dispatched.
- When: TruthCapsule linkage is checked.
- Then: a `truth_capsule_id` exists linked by `(group_id, leg_idx, intent_hash)`.
- Pass criteria: linkage exists for every dispatch.
- Fail criteria: any dispatch without linkage.

AT-250
- Given: TruthCapsule write fails.
- When: the system evaluates opens.
- Then: opens are blocked and system enters ReduceOnly.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly enforced; OPEN blocked.
- Fail criteria: OPEN proceeds after write failure.

AT-251
- Given: forced slow disk / slow writer with a bounded queue capacity `N`.
- When: TruthCapsule writes are enqueued to saturation.
- Then: queue size never exceeds `N`; the hot loop does not block; if backpressure occurs, the system enters ReduceOnly rather than stalling.
- Pass criteria: queue <= `N`; hot loop remains non-blocking; ReduceOnly on backpressure.
- Fail criteria: queue exceeds `N`, hot loop stalls, or remains Active under backpressure.

AT-252
- Given: writer thread/process errors OR queue overflows.
- When: TruthCapsule writer reports failures.
- Then: `truth_capsule_write_errors` increments and trading is forced to ReduceOnly until healthy.
- Pass criteria: error counter increments; ReduceOnly enforced.
- Fail criteria: counter not incremented or mode remains Active.

AT-253
- Given: an attribution row is written for a filled leg.
- When: the row joins to TruthCapsule.
- Then: it reproduces `limit_price_sent`, `gross_edge_usd_est`, `predicted_slippage_bps_sim`.
- Pass criteria: join succeeds and fields match.
- Fail criteria: join fails or fields mismatch.

AT-044
- Given: a Decision Snapshot is emitted.
- When: the Truth Capsule is recorded.
- Then: `decision_snapshot_id` exists and `l2_snapshot_id` does not exist.
- Pass criteria: exactly one canonical field present.
- Fail criteria: alias field appears or canonical field missing.

### **4.4 Fill Simulator (Shadow Mode Book-Walk)**
Profile: GOP

**Council Weakness Covered:** Constraint relief — execution reality feedback loop. **Where:** `soldier/core/sim/exchange.rs` **Requirement:** Before live fire, run Shadow Mode that simulates fills by walking L2 depth and applying maker/taker fees. **Algorithm:**

* Walk the book to compute WAP for size.  
* Apply fee model.  
* Persist alongside real attribution logs for comparison.

**Schema Parity Rule:**
Shadow mode must write the SAME Parquet schema as live (§4.3) with `mode = shadow|live`.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-254
- Given: a fixed L2 snapshot and order size.
- When: the fill simulator runs.
- Then: it outputs deterministic WAP + `slippage_bps`, and `slippage_bps(size=2x) > slippage_bps(size=1x)` on a thin book.
- Pass criteria: deterministic outputs and monotonic slippage with size.
- Fail criteria: non-deterministic output or slippage not increasing with size.


---

### **4.5 Slippage Calibration (Reality Sync)**
Profile: GOP

**Why this exists:** Replay + Shadow fills are useless if they assume “fantasy liquidity.” We must continuously measure **Sim vs Live** and penalize simulation optimism.

**Requirement:** For every **live fill**, compute:
- `predicted_slippage_bps_sim`: from **Fill Simulator** on the same L2 snapshot used at decision time.
- `realized_slippage_bps_live`: from attribution logs (fill vs fair/limit).

**Calibrate:** Maintain a rolling penalty:
- `realism_penalty_factor = clamp(p50(realized_slippage_bps_live / max(predicted_slippage_bps_sim, eps)), 1.0, 2.5)`
- Window: last **N fills** (default `N=200`)
- Bucket by: `strategy_id`, `instrument_type`, `liquidity_bucket` (use Liquidity Gate depth buckets)

**Enforce:** Replay Gatekeeper **MUST apply** this penalty (see §5.2).

**Where:**
- Python: `commander/analytics/slippage_calibration.py`
- Rust (optional): `soldier/core/analytics/slippage_calibration.rs`

**Data contract (minimum):**
- Persist `predicted_slippage_bps_sim` alongside each live decision so the ratio is well-defined.
- Persist the factor used in every policy proposal.

**Acceptance Test (REQUIRED):**
AT-255
- Given: 50 synthetic fills where `realized = sim * 1.2`.
- When: slippage calibration runs.
- Then: `realism_penalty_factor → ~1.2` and stable (±0.05); if missing/uninitialized, default factor = 1.3 and tighten opens.
- Pass criteria: factor converges to ~1.2; default applied when missing.
- Fail criteria: factor diverges or missing factor does not default.

## **5\. Self-Improvement: The Closed-Loop Control**
Profile: GOP

### **5.1 The Optimization Cycle (Python)**

A daily cron job ingests Parquet data to calculate realized friction and generate policy patches.

**Closed-Loop Rules (Example):**
1. If `avg_slippage_bps > target_bps` → increase `min_edge_usd` by 10%.
2. If `fill_rate < 5%` → decrease `limit_distance_bps` slightly.
3. If `atomic_naked_events > 0` → decrease `max_order_usd` + force ReduceOnly for cooldown window.

**Governor (Safety):**
- Clamp changes within bounds (implementation-defined safe ranges for each parameter).
- Require "dry-run" mode first: logs patch, does not apply.

**Implementation:** `python/optimizer/closed_loop.py`


---


### **5.2 Replay Gatekeeper (48h Policy Regression Test)**

**Requirement:** No policy patch may be applied unless ReplayQuality is GOOD or DEGRADED and the tightening-only rules are satisfied.

**Replay Quality Ladder (Normative):**
ReplayQuality ∈ { `GOOD`, `DEGRADED`, `BROKEN` }  
ReplayApplyMode ∈ { `APPLY`, `APPLY_WITH_HAIRCUT`, `SHADOW_ONLY` }

ReplayQuality is derived from snapshot coverage and snapshot readability for the replay window:
- **GOOD:** `snapshot_coverage_pct >= 95` AND Decision Snapshots are readable for the full window.
- **DEGRADED:** `80 <= snapshot_coverage_pct < 95` AND Decision Snapshots are readable (writer healthy).
- **BROKEN:** `snapshot_coverage_pct < 80` OR Decision Snapshots cannot be written/read OR coverage cannot be computed.

ReplayApplyMode mapping:
- **GOOD → APPLY**
- **DEGRADED → APPLY_WITH_HAIRCUT** (tightening-only patches only)
- **BROKEN → SHADOW_ONLY** (no policy apply)

CSP trading is unaffected; this ladder gates GOP policy evolution only.

**Prereq (must implement):**
- **Decision Snapshots (required):** Every dispatched intent MUST reference a decision-time snapshot via `decision_snapshot_id` (see §4.3.2).
- Track `snapshot_coverage_pct` over the replay window (48h): `% of dispatched intents with a valid `decision_snapshot_id` AND snapshot payload available`.
- **Replay Required Inputs (Non-Negotiable):**
  - **Decision Snapshots are REQUIRED** for replay validity (see §4.3.2).
  - ReplayQuality MUST be computed using the ladder above; coverage degradation alone MUST NOT force `RiskState::Degraded`.

**Parameter definition (REQUIRED to make the gate enforceable):**
- `dd_limit` is the maximum allowable `replay_max_drawdown_usd` for the 48h replay window, in USD.
- `dd_limit` MUST be explicitly configured (no implicit default). If missing/unparseable, Replay Gatekeeper MUST HARD FAIL (fail-closed).
- **Full tick/L2 archives are OPTIONAL (diagnostics/research), not required for the gate:**
  - If full tick/L2 archives are paused due to disk watermarks (§7.2), Replay Gatekeeper continues using Decision Snapshots.
  - Archive pause MUST NOT, by itself, force `RiskState::Degraded`.
  - If Decision Snapshots cannot be written/read: EvidenceGuard MUST treat EvidenceChainState as not GREEN when `enforced_profile != CSP` (ReduceOnly), and ReplayQuality MUST be BROKEN.
  - Coverage degradation alone MUST NOT force ReduceOnly; it only affects ReplayQuality and replay apply mode.
- Maintain `realism_penalty_factor` from §4.5 (fail-safe default if missing).

**Where:** `python/governor/replay_gatekeeper.py`

**Validation rules (hard gates):**
- `replay_atomic_naked_events == 0`
- `replay_max_drawdown_usd <= dd_limit`

**Required parameter (fail-closed):**
- `dd_limit` is the maximum allowable `replay_max_drawdown_usd` over the 48h replay window, in USD.
- `dd_limit` MUST be provided by configuration; if missing or unparseable, Replay Gatekeeper MUST HARD FAIL (fail-closed).

**Realism penalty enforcement (non-negotiable):**
Replay uses FillSimulator impact costs; **penalize** them using the calibrated factor:
- Option A (simple): `impact_cost_usd := impact_cost_usd * realism_penalty_factor`
- Option B (explicit):  
  `replay_net_pnl_penalized = replay_net_pnl_raw - (abs(replay_slippage_cost_usd) * (realism_penalty_factor - 1.0))`

**Profitability gate (hard release gate):**
- Reject if `replay_net_pnl_penalized <= 0`

**Decision:**
- If **fail** → reject patch, log reason; keep current policy.
- If **pass** AND `ReplayQuality == GOOD` → approve patch for rollout (still subject to canary staging §5.3).
- If **pass** AND `ReplayQuality == DEGRADED` → approve ONLY if tightening-only rules are satisfied; set `ReplayApplyMode = APPLY_WITH_HAIRCUT`.
- If `ReplayQuality == BROKEN` → `ReplayApplyMode = SHADOW_ONLY` (no patch apply; shadow evaluation allowed).

**Policy Patch Tightening Classifier (Normative):**
A patch is **tightening-only** iff for every parameter it changes, the delta moves in the parameter’s tightening direction or is unchanged.
Any parameter not listed in the table below is treated as **LOOSEN**.
All parameters MUST remain within explicit bounds; missing bounds are a fail-closed error.

**Tightening Table (Authoritative):**
| Parameter | Tighten direction | Bounds (config keys; MUST be explicit) |
|---|---|---|
| `min_edge_usd` | **increase** | `min_edge_usd_min` / `min_edge_usd_max` |
| `limit_distance_bps` | **decrease** | `limit_distance_bps_min` / `limit_distance_bps_max` |
| `max_order_usd` | **decrease** | `max_order_usd_min` / `max_order_usd_max` |
| `inventory_skew_k` | **increase** | `inventory_skew_k_min` / `inventory_skew_k_max` |
| `inventory_skew_tick_penalty_max` | **increase** | `inventory_skew_tick_penalty_max_min` / `inventory_skew_tick_penalty_max_max` |

**Parameter semantics (binding):**
- `max_order_usd` is the **per‑OPEN intent** notional cap enforced at the order‑intent chokepoint before quantization.

**Haircut Enforcement (Hard Runtime Gate):**
When `ReplayApplyMode == APPLY_WITH_HAIRCUT`, the order‑intent chokepoint (`build_order_intent()`) MUST apply `open_haircut_mult` to **all OPEN intents** before quantization.
- `open_haircut_mult` MUST be in `(0, 1]` and MUST be explicitly configured.
- Missing/unparseable/out‑of‑range `open_haircut_mult` ⇒ treat as BROKEN and force `ReplayApplyMode = SHADOW_ONLY` (fail‑closed).
- This is a **hard runtime gate**; logs alone do not satisfy this requirement.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-256
- Given: an order/intent is dispatched.
- When: Decision Snapshot linkage is checked.
- Then: it MUST join via `decision_snapshot_id`.
- Pass criteria: linkage exists for every dispatch.
- Fail criteria: any dispatch without a valid `decision_snapshot_id`.

AT-257
- Given: `snapshot_coverage_pct = 90` (DEGRADED), Decision Snapshots are readable, `open_haircut_mult = 0.50`, and the patch deltas are tightening-only per the table.
- When: Replay Gatekeeper runs and the patch is applied.
- Then: `ReplayQuality == DEGRADED`, `ReplayApplyMode == APPLY_WITH_HAIRCUT`, and OPEN dispatch sizes reflect the haircut.
- Pass criteria: apply mode is `APPLY_WITH_HAIRCUT`; OPEN dispatch size is <= quantized(original * `open_haircut_mult`); CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL sizes are unchanged.
- Fail criteria: apply occurs without haircut, apply mode is incorrect, or loosening deltas are accepted.

AT-002
- Given: `snapshot_coverage_pct == 95%` and Decision Snapshots are readable.
- When: Replay Gatekeeper runs.
- Then: `ReplayQuality == GOOD` and `ReplayApplyMode == APPLY`.
- Pass criteria: apply mode is APPLY at exactly 95%.
- Fail criteria: any non-APPLY mode at 95% OR APPLY when < 95%.

AT-1062
- Given: `snapshot_coverage_pct < 80%` OR Decision Snapshots are unreadable/unwritable.
- When: Replay Gatekeeper runs.
- Then: `ReplayQuality == BROKEN` and `ReplayApplyMode == SHADOW_ONLY`.
- Pass criteria: patch is not applied; shadow evaluation only.
- Fail criteria: any patch apply occurs while BROKEN.

Profile: CSP
AT-1070 (CSP Isolation from Replay/Snapshot Failures)
- Given: `enforced_profile == CSP` AND any of the following conditions:
  - `snapshot_coverage_pct == 0%` (complete coverage loss)
  - Decision Snapshots are unreadable/unwritable
  - `ReplayQuality == BROKEN`
  - Replay Gatekeeper is unavailable or erroring
- When: the system evaluates TradingMode and OPEN eligibility.
- Then:
  - `TradingMode` MUST NOT be forced to ReduceOnly/Kill solely due to replay/snapshot subsystem state.
  - `RiskState` MUST NOT become Degraded solely due to replay/snapshot subsystem state.
  - OPEN intents MUST remain eligible (subject to other CSP gates).
- Pass criteria: OPEN dispatch occurs while replay subsystem is BROKEN; TradingMode remains Active (assuming no other triggers).
- Fail criteria: OPEN blocked, TradingMode degraded, or RiskState degraded solely due to replay/snapshot failure when `enforced_profile == CSP`.

AT-1064
- Given: `ReplayQuality == DEGRADED` and a patch includes a loosening delta OR any parameter not in the tightening table.
- When: Replay Gatekeeper evaluates the patch.
- Then: the patch MUST NOT be applied (shadow-only or explicit reject).
- Pass criteria: no apply; current policy remains active.
- Fail criteria: patch is applied despite loosening/unknown parameters.

AT-258
- Given: disk watermark pauses full tick/L2 archives.
- When: Replay Gatekeeper evaluates inputs.
- Then: it continues using Decision Snapshots and MUST NOT force `RiskState::Degraded` solely due to archive pause.
- Pass criteria: no Degraded solely from archive pause.
- Fail criteria: Degraded triggered by archive pause alone.

AT-259
- Given: a policy passes replay pre-penalty checks and `ReplayQuality == GOOD`.
- When: Replay Gatekeeper completes.
- Then: it approves the patch for rollout (still subject to canary staging §5.3).
- Pass criteria: PASS + GOOD leads to approval.
- Fail criteria: PASS + GOOD does not approve or FAIL approves.

AT-431
- Given: `replay_atomic_naked_events > 0`.
- When: Replay Gatekeeper runs.
- Then: it MUST FAIL and the patch remains blocked.
- Pass criteria: gate fails; patch not eligible for canary rollout.
- Fail criteria: gate passes or patch proceeds with atomic naked events.

AT-432
- Given: `replay_net_pnl_penalized <= 0` after realism penalty is applied.
- When: Replay Gatekeeper runs.
- Then: it MUST FAIL and the patch remains blocked.
- Pass criteria: gate fails; patch not eligible for canary rollout.
- Fail criteria: gate passes or patch proceeds with non-positive penalized PnL.

**Acceptance Tests:**

AT-034
- Given: Replay Gatekeeper is invoked and `dd_limit` is missing or unparseable.
- When: the gate evaluates `replay_max_drawdown_usd`.
- Then: the gate HARD FAILS and the patch remains blocked (last stable policy stays active).
- Pass criteria: patch is not eligible for canary rollout.
- Fail criteria: patch becomes eligible without a valid `dd_limit`.

**Why this exists:** This closes the TOC constraint of “open-loop” policy pushes and prevents the system from training on fantasy liquidity.

### **5.3 Policy Canary Rollout (Staged Activation)**
Profile: GOP

**Requirement:** Any new policy that passes Replay Gatekeeper must roll out in stages.

**Stages:**
- Stage 0: Shadow Only (no live orders). Duration: 6–24h or N signals.
- Stage 1: Live Canary (tiny size, e.g., 10–20% of normal). Duration: 2–6h or N fills.
- Stage 2: Full Live.

**Abort Conditions (Immediate rollback to previous policy + ReduceOnly cooldown):**
- `atomic_naked_events > 0`
- `p95_slippage_bps > slippage_limit`
- `fill_rate < fill_rate_floor` AND strategy attempts > canary_min_attempts
- `net_pnl_usd < pnl_floor`
- EvidenceChainState != GREEN continuously for at least `canary_evidence_abort_s` seconds
- Any abort condition triggers immediate rollback to last stable policy + sets ReduceOnly cooldown per §7.1.4.

**Abort threshold parameters (fail-closed):**
- `slippage_limit` is a p95 slippage threshold in bps for the canary window.
- `fill_rate_floor` is a minimum fill-rate threshold in [0,1] for the canary window.
- `canary_min_attempts` is the minimum number of strategy attempts before the fill-rate abort condition can trigger.
- `pnl_floor` is a minimum allowable net PnL threshold in USD for the canary window.
- `canary_evidence_abort_s` is the minimum continuous EvidenceChainState != GREEN duration before abort.
- `canary_evidence_abort_s` MUST be >= (`evidenceguard_window_s` + `evidenceguard_global_cooldown`).
- All five MUST be provided by configuration; if any is missing/unparseable or violates the constraint above, canary preflight MUST FAIL (fail-closed) and the patch MUST NOT be promoted. The failure MUST be logged with reason code `CanaryEvidenceAbortMisconfigured`.

AT-035
- Given: canary preflight runs and at least one of `slippage_limit`, `fill_rate_floor`, `canary_min_attempts`, `pnl_floor`, `canary_evidence_abort_s` is missing/unparseable.
- When: the abort parameter set is evaluated.
- Then: preflight MUST FAIL (fail-closed), the patch MUST NOT start canary, and `CanaryEvidenceAbortMisconfigured` is logged.
- Pass criteria: preflight fails; canary does not start; reason code logged.
- Fail criteria: canary starts or preflight passes without valid abort thresholds.

AT-036
- Given: canary rollout runs with `slippage_limit` configured and observed `p95_slippage_bps > slippage_limit`.
- When: the abort evaluator runs.
- Then: immediate rollback occurs and ReduceOnly cooldown is enforced.
- Pass criteria: policy is rolled back and cooldown prevents opens.
- Fail criteria: policy remains active despite slippage abort condition.

AT-433
- Given: canary rollout runs with `fill_rate_floor` configured and observed `fill_rate < fill_rate_floor` with attempts > `canary_min_attempts`.
- When: the abort evaluator runs.
- Then: immediate rollback occurs and ReduceOnly cooldown is enforced.
- Pass criteria: policy is rolled back and cooldown prevents opens.
- Fail criteria: policy remains active despite fill-rate abort condition.

AT-434
- Given: canary rollout runs with `pnl_floor` configured and observed `net_pnl_usd < pnl_floor`.
- When: the abort evaluator runs.
- Then: immediate rollback occurs and ReduceOnly cooldown is enforced.
- Pass criteria: policy is rolled back and cooldown prevents opens.
- Fail criteria: policy remains active despite pnl abort condition.

AT-435
- Given: canary rollout runs and EvidenceChainState != GREEN continuously for `canary_evidence_abort_s + 1` seconds.
- When: the abort evaluator runs.
- Then: immediate rollback occurs and ReduceOnly cooldown is enforced.
- Pass criteria: policy is rolled back and cooldown prevents opens.
- Fail criteria: policy remains active despite EvidenceChainState abort condition.

AT-436
- Given: `atomic_naked_events > 0` during canary.
- When: the abort evaluator runs.
- Then: immediate rollback occurs and ReduceOnly cooldown is enforced.
- Pass criteria: policy is rolled back and cooldown prevents opens.
- Fail criteria: policy remains active despite atomic naked event.

AT-972
- Given: `canary_evidence_abort_s < (evidenceguard_window_s + evidenceguard_global_cooldown)`.
- When: canary preflight evaluates the patch for promotion.
- Then: preflight MUST FAIL (fail-closed) and the patch MUST NOT start canary; log `CanaryEvidenceAbortMisconfigured`.
- Pass criteria: preflight fails and canary does not start.
- Fail criteria: canary starts or preflight passes.

AT-973
- Given: `canary_evidence_abort_s = (evidenceguard_window_s + evidenceguard_global_cooldown) + 30`, and EvidenceChainState becomes != GREEN for exactly (`evidenceguard_window_s + evidenceguard_global_cooldown`) seconds, then returns to GREEN and remains GREEN.
- When: the abort evaluator runs across the event.
- Then: canary MUST NOT abort solely due to this transient evidence incident.
- Pass criteria: canary remains running; no rollback triggered by EvidenceNotGreen.
- Fail criteria: canary aborts despite the incident staying within the recovery horizon.

**WAL queue invariants:**
- `wal_queue_depth` MUST be integer >= 0.
- `wal_queue_capacity` MUST be integer > 0.
- `wal_queue_depth` MUST be <= `wal_queue_capacity`.

- `429_count` and `10028_count` MUST NOT be used.
- `atomic_naked_events_24h` MUST be an integer counter (rolling 24h count) with valid range >= 0.



**/status F1_CERT fields (contract-bound semantics):**
- `f1_cert_state` (string enum; derived by PolicyGuard):
  - `PASS`: F1_CERT present, within freshness window, and binding matches runtime (§2.2.1).
  - `FAIL`: F1_CERT present but `f1_cert.status == "FAIL"`.
  - `STALE`: F1_CERT present but `now_ms - f1_cert.generated_ts_ms > (f1_cert_freshness_window_s * 1000)`.

  - If F1_CERT is present and parseable: `f1_cert.generated_ts_ms + (f1_cert_freshness_window_s * 1000)`.
  - If F1_CERT is missing/unparseable: MUST be `null`.

### **7.1 Review Loop (Autopilot Reviewer + Minimal Human Touch)**
Profile: GOP

**Purpose (TOC constraint relief):** Close the “open-loop” trap by turning logs into **deterministic review outcomes**.
If nobody (human or machine) is accountable for reading the logs, you still have a lawnmower engine—just with nicer gauges.

#### **7.1.1 What MUST be logged (audit trail)**
The system MUST persist enough to reconstruct every action and policy change:
- **Execution decisions:** order intents, gates evaluated, chosen action (place/cancel/flatten), and reason codes.
- **Lifecycle events:** TLSM transitions for every order/leg.
- **Policy events:** proposed patch, replay result, canary stage result, and final applied/rejected decision.
- **Incidents:** any entry into ReduceOnly/Kill, and why.

**Artifacts (append-only, reviewable):**
- `artifacts/decision_log.jsonl` (one record per decision; small + append-only)
- `artifacts/policy_patches/<ts>_patch.json` + `artifacts/policy_patches/<ts>_result.json`
- `artifacts/reviews/<YYYY-MM-DD>/daily_review.json` + `daily_review.md`
- `artifacts/incidents/<ts>_<type>.json` + `<ts>_<type>.md`

#### **7.1.2 Who reviews (and when)**
**A) AutoReviewer (deterministic, required):**
- Runs **daily** and **on incident trigger**.
- Inputs: Parquet attribution, decision_log, current policy, last 24h metrics (same window as F1 cert).
- Outputs: one of:
  - `NO_ACTION`
  - `AUTO_APPLY_SAFE_PATCH`
  - `REQUIRE_HUMAN_APPROVAL`
  - `FORCE_REDUCEONLY_COOLDOWN`
  - `FORCE_KILL`

**Where:** `python/reviewer/daily_ops_review.py` and `python/reviewer/incident_review.py`

**B) Human (you) — only when the change increases risk:**
You are NOT “reviewing everything.” You only approve **risk-increasing** changes.
Human review is required if:
- Patch loosens gates or increases sizing/frequency/leverage, or
- Any incident fired in the last 24h (atomic naked event, 429/10028 burst, slippage blowout), or
- F1 cert is FAIL.

Human approval is recorded as: `artifacts/HUMAN_APPROVAL.json` (explicit allow-list for the patch id).

#### **7.1.3 Auto-approval rules (what the system may change without you)**
AutoReviewer may **only** auto-apply a patch if ALL are true:
1) Patch is classified as **SAFE** (tightens gates / reduces risk; never increases exposure).
2) Replay Gatekeeper PASS (§5.2) and Canary staging PASS (§5.3).
3) No incident triggers in the last 24h.

Patch classification MUST be embedded in the patch:
`patch_meta.impact = SAFE | NEUTRAL | AGGRESSIVE`

AGGRESSIVE always requires `HUMAN_APPROVAL.json`.

#### **7.1.4 Incident-triggered review (automatic “post-mortem”)**
Profile: GOP
If any of the following occur, the system MUST generate an incident report and enforce containment:
- `atomic_naked_events > 0`
- `429_count_5m > 0` OR `10028_count_5m > 0`
- canary abort (slippage blowout / pnl floor breach)

**Required actions:**
- Immediate `TradingMode::ReduceOnly` cooldown (duration configured; default 6–24h).
- Produce `artifacts/incidents/<ts>_incident.md` with:
  - Timeline (first bad event → containment → flat)
  - Root cause tag (liquidity / rate limit / WS gap / policy drift / sizing)
  - “What would have prevented this” (which gate failed or was missing)
  - Next patch recommendation (SAFE only unless human approves)

#### **7.1.5 Acceptance Tests**
AT-274
- Given: daily review runs.
- When: review output is written.

- Pass criteria: log entry exists with required fields.
- Fail criteria: missing log entry or missing required fields.

AT-903
- Given: a policy change is applied.
- When: `artifacts/policy_patches/<ts>_patch.json` is written.
- Then: `patch_meta.impact` exists and is one of `SAFE|NEUTRAL|AGGRESSIVE`.
- Pass criteria: valid `patch_meta.impact` present.
- Fail criteria: missing impact or invalid value.

AT-904
- Given: an incident trigger occurs (`atomic_naked_events > 0` or `429_count_5m > 0` or `10028_count_5m > 0`).
- When: incident handling runs.
- Then: `artifacts/incidents/<ts>_incident.md` is generated with timeline, root cause tag, prevention note, and next patch recommendation.
- Pass criteria: report exists with required sections.
- Fail criteria: missing report or missing required sections.


### **7.2 Data Retention & Disk Watermarks — MUST implement**
Profile: GOP

**Goal:** Prevent “disk full → corrupted logs → blind trading decisions.”

**Retention defaults (configurable):**
- Tick/L2 archives: keep **72h** (rolling) (compressed).
- Parquet analytics (attribution + truth capsules): keep **30d** (compressed).
- **Decision Snapshots (REQUIRED replay input; see §4.3.2):** rolling retention window for Decision Snapshot partitions.
  - Default: `decision_snapshot_retention_days = 30` (configurable).
  - Hard lower bound: `decision_snapshot_retention_days` MUST be ≥ `ceil(replay_window_hours / 24)` (Replay Gatekeeper window; default 48h → 2 days; see §5.2).
  - Safety invariant: retention MUST NOT delete any Decision Snapshots that fall within the window used to compute `snapshot_coverage_pct`.
  - Storage model requirement: Decision Snapshots MUST be partitioned by day (or hour) so retention deletes only cold partitions (never hot writer partitions).
- WAL / intent ledger: keep **indefinitely** (small, critical).

**Disk watermarks (hard rules):**
- `disk_used_pct` is a ratio in [0.0, 1.0] (e.g., 0.80 == 80%).
- `disk_used_pct >= disk_pause_archives_pct` → stop full tick + L2 archives; keep Kline + trades.
- `disk_used_pct >= disk_degraded_pct` → enter RiskState::Degraded and force ReduceOnly.
- `disk_used_pct >= disk_kill_pct` → enter Kill (block OPEN; allow containment dispatch while exposed per §2.2.3.6); run retention reclaim immediately.

**Automatic retention reclaim (non-blocking):**
- The system MUST implement `retention_reclaim()` to prevent the `disk_degraded_pct`→`disk_kill_pct` death spiral.
- Triggering:
  - `disk_used_pct >= disk_pause_archives_pct`: best-effort reclaim (background task; rate-limited, e.g., ≤ 1 run/hour).
  - `disk_used_pct >= disk_degraded_pct`: mandatory reclaim (repeat until `disk_used_pct < disk_pause_archives_pct` OR no reclaimable data remains).
- Eligible deletions (ONLY beyond configured retention windows; delete cold partitions only):
  - Tick/L2 archives older than retention (default 72h).
  - Parquet analytics (attribution + truth capsules) older than retention (default 30d).
  - Decision Snapshots older than `decision_snapshot_retention_days`, subject to replay-window safety below.
- Safety invariants:
  - MUST NOT delete WAL / intent ledger (indefinite).
  - MUST NOT delete any Decision Snapshot partition that intersects the current replay window used to compute `snapshot_coverage_pct`.
  - MUST NOT delete hot writer partitions (current open partition(s)); reclaim operates only on closed partitions.
- Evidence:
  - Each reclaim run MUST write `artifacts/disk_reclaim/<ts>_reclaim.json` containing: reclaimed_bytes, cutoff_ts per dataset, disk_used_pct_before/after.
  - Reclaim MUST NOT stall the hot loop; it runs as a low-priority async/background task.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-260
- Given: simulated `disk_used_pct >= disk_pause_archives_pct`.
- When: disk watermark logic runs.
- Then: full tick/L2 archive writing stops; Decision Snapshots continue.
- Pass criteria: archives paused; Decision Snapshots still recorded.
- Fail criteria: archives continue or Decision Snapshots stop.

AT-261
- Given: simulated `disk_used_pct >= disk_degraded_pct`.
- When: disk watermark logic runs.
- Then: system enters `RiskState::Degraded` and enforces ReduceOnly until back under `disk_pause_archives_pct`.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly enforced; exits only after recovery.
- Fail criteria: remains Active or exits early.

AT-262
- Given: simulated `disk_used_pct >= disk_kill_pct` AND net exposure ≠ 0.
- When: disk watermark logic runs.
- Then: `TradingMode == Kill`; OPEN intents are blocked; risk-reducing containment dispatch attempts are permitted/attempted per §2.2.3.6.
- Pass criteria: mode is Kill; OPEN dispatch count remains 0; at least one risk-reducing dispatch attempt occurs while exposure ≠ 0.
- Fail criteria: any OPEN dispatch occurs, OR the system forbids all dispatch while exposure ≠ 0, OR mode not Kill.

AT-263
- Given: simulated `disk_used_pct >= disk_degraded_pct`.
- When: `retention_reclaim()` runs.
- Then: it deletes only cold partitions older than retention; MUST NOT touch WAL; MUST NOT delete Decision Snapshot data within the replay window.
- Pass criteria: only eligible cold partitions reclaimed; WAL and replay-window data untouched.
- Fail criteria: WAL touched or replay-window data deleted.

AT-942
- Given: a crash occurs during `retention_reclaim()` after some cold partitions are deleted but before the reclaim run is finalized.
- When: the system restarts and runs `retention_reclaim()` again.
- Then: it must NOT delete WAL, must NOT delete hot writer partitions, and must NOT delete Decision Snapshot data within the replay window; reclaim must remain consistent.
- Pass criteria: WAL intact; hot partitions intact; replay-window data intact; next reclaim completes and writes the reclaim artifact.
- Fail criteria: WAL touched, hot partitions deleted, replay-window data deleted, or reclaim leaves inconsistent state.

**Minimum alerts add:**
- `disk_used_pct >= disk_pause_archives_pct`
- `parquet_write_errors > 0`
- `truth_capsule_write_errors > 0`

## **8. Release Gates (F1 Certification Checklist — HARD PASS/FAIL)**
Profile: GOP

This checklist is a **hard release gate**. No version may be promoted
(Shadow → Testnet → Live) unless an automated cert run produces:

- `artifacts/F1_CERT.json` with `"status": "PASS"`
- and a human-readable `artifacts/F1_CERT.md` summary

### **8.1 Measurable Metrics (PASS/FAIL)**
Metrics must be computed over the last **24h** window for Shadow and Testnet.
Production uses rolling 24h once live.

|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Atomic Safety | atomic_naked_events == 0 | 0 | 0 | REQUIRED |
| Rate Limits | N/A | 429_count_5m==0 AND 10028_count_5m==0 | 0 | REQUIRED |
| WS Gap Recovery (book) | N/A | p95 <= 5s | p95 <= 10s | REQUIRED |
| WS Gap Recovery (private) | N/A | p95 <= 10s | p95 <= 20s | PASS |
| Time Drift | N/A | p99_clock_drift <= 50ms | <= 50ms | REQUIRED |
| p95 Slippage | <= 5 bps | <= 8 bps | <= 10 bps | PASS |
| IOC Fill Rate | >= 40% | >= 30% | >= 25% | PASS |
| Emergency Time-to-DeltaNeutral | N/A | <= 2s | <= 3s | REQUIRED |
| Fee Drag Ratio | N/A | fee_drag_usd / gross_edge_usd (rolling 7d) < 0.35 | < 0.35 | REQUIRED |
| Net Edge After Fees | N/A | rolling 7d avg(net_edge_usd) > 0 | > 0 | REQUIRED |
| Zombie Orders | 0 | 0 | 0 | REQUIRED |
| Attribution Completeness | rows == fills | rows == fills | rows == fills | REQUIRED |
| Replay Profit (penalized) | > 0 | > 0 | > 0 | REQUIRED |

**Notes:**
- “Replay Profit (penalized)” uses `realism_penalty_factor` from §4.5 and the hard reject rule from §5.2.

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-264
- Given: Time-to-DeltaNeutral >= 2s in any incident.
- When: scaling/promotion is evaluated.
- Then: scaling is blocked (Sniper-only).
- Pass criteria: scaling blocked.
- Fail criteria: scaling proceeds.

AT-265

Profile: CSP
**B) Chaos/Integration Scenarios**
AT-328
- Given: Leg A Filled, Leg B Rejected.
- When: containment runs.

AT-330
- Given: 10028/too_many_requests session termination.
- When: session kill handling runs.

Profile: GOP
**C) Replay Simulation**
AT-331

- When: Replay Gatekeeper evaluates the policy.
- Then: the policy fails.
- Pass criteria: FAIL when penalized profit ≤ 0.
- Fail criteria: PASS despite penalized loss.

### **8.3 Canary Rollout Protocol (Hard Gate)**
Policy staging in §5.3 is mandatory. Promotion requires:

- Stage 0 (Shadow) PASS for 6–24h
- Stage 1 (Testnet micro-canary) PASS for 2–6h
- Any abort trigger → rollback + ReduceOnly cooldown

### **8.4 Certification Artifact (Hard Gate Implementation)**

- outputs `artifacts/F1_CERT.json` and `artifacts/F1_CERT.md`
- `artifacts/F1_CERT.json` MUST include (minimum): `{ status, generated_ts_ms, build_id, runtime_config_hash, contract_version }` (see §2.2.1).

**Example CI command:**

## **Appendix A: Configuration Defaults (Safety-Critical Thresholds)**

This appendix defines default values for safety-critical configuration parameters referenced throughout the contract. These defaults provide fail-safe behavior and deterministic acceptance testing.

**Enforcement (Non-Negotiable):** If a safety-critical config value is missing at runtime, the Soldier MUST apply the default from this appendix **if it is defined here**; otherwise it MUST fail-closed by blocking the associated capability (no silent defaults).

### **A.CSP Core Safety Defaults**
Profile: CSP

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-341
- Given: config missing `instrument_cache_ttl_s` and `mm_util_kill` at runtime.
- When: safety-critical defaults are applied from Appendix A for `instrument_cache_ttl_s` and `mm_util_kill`.
- Then: defaults are used (`instrument_cache_ttl_s = 3600`, `mm_util_kill = 0.95`) and enforcement uses those defaults (no implicit zero/none).
- Pass criteria: defaults apply and gating behavior matches the documented defaults.
- Fail criteria: parameters fall back to zero/none or remain unset while still allowing behavior.

AT-424
- Given: each CSP safety-critical config value listed in Appendix A.CSP is omitted at runtime (one-at-a-time), with other gates satisfied.
- When: the associated gate computes its decision.
- Then: the Appendix A default is used for that parameter.
- Pass criteria: gate behavior matches the documented default for each parameter under test.
- Fail criteria: any parameter uses implicit/zero/none or gate behavior does not match Appendix A default.

### **A.GOP Governance & Optimization Defaults**
Profile: GOP

**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
AT-040
- Given: a safety-critical gate references a required parameter that has no Appendix A default (e.g., `dd_limit` in §5.2).
- When: that parameter is missing or unparseable at runtime.
- Then: the gate MUST fail-closed (block policy application / rollout) and surface a deterministic reason.
- Pass criteria: the system blocks the associated capability until the parameter is provided.
- Fail criteria: the system proceeds using an implicit/zero/none default.

AT-970
- Given: config missing `evidenceguard_global_cooldown` and `replay_window_hours` at runtime.
- When: GOP defaults are applied from Appendix A for `evidenceguard_global_cooldown` and `replay_window_hours`.
- Then: defaults are used (`evidenceguard_global_cooldown = 120`, `replay_window_hours = 48`) and enforcement uses those defaults (no implicit zero/none).
- Pass criteria: defaults apply and gating behavior matches the documented defaults.
- Fail criteria: parameters fall back to zero/none or remain unset while still allowing behavior.

AT-971
- Given: each GOP safety-critical config value listed in Appendix A.GOP is omitted at runtime (one-at-a-time), with other gates satisfied.
- When: the associated gate computes its decision.
- Then: the Appendix A default is used for that parameter.
- Pass criteria: gate behavior matches the documented default for each parameter under test.
- Fail criteria: any parameter uses implicit/zero/none or gate behavior does not match Appendix A default.

**`canary_evidence_abort_s`** (§5.3 Policy Canary Rollout)
- **Default**: `180` seconds (must be >= `evidenceguard_window_s + evidenceguard_global_cooldown`).
- **Purpose**: Minimum continuous EvidenceChainState != GREEN duration before canary abort.
- **Rationale**: Calibrated to EvidenceGuard window + cooldown to avoid aborting on expected recovery.

Profile: CSP
### **A.1 Atomic Group Execution**

**`atomic_qty_epsilon`** (§1.2 Atomic Group Executor)
- **Default**: `1e-9` (in the same units as `filled_qty`)
- **Purpose**: Tolerance for declaring "no fill mismatch" between legs
- **Rationale**: Tiny epsilon tolerates only floating-point rounding noise, not meaningful exposure mismatch
AT-278
- Given: two legs filled at nominally equal quantities differing only by ≤ `atomic_qty_epsilon` (no partials).
- When: group completion is evaluated.
- Then: the group is eligible for `Complete`.
- Pass criteria: `Complete` eligibility holds.
- Fail criteria: completion rejected due only to epsilon-level difference.

**`instrument_cache_ttl_s`** (§1.0.X Instrument Metadata Freshness)
- **Default**: `3600` seconds
- **Purpose**: Default TTL for instrument metadata freshness; stale metadata triggers Degraded + ReduceOnly.
AT-279
- Given: `instrument_cache_age_s > instrument_cache_ttl_s`.
- When: instrument freshness is evaluated.
- Then: `RiskState::Degraded` + ReduceOnly within one tick; CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL allowed.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly enforced with Degraded.
- Fail criteria: remains Active or blocks closes.

**`contracts_amount_match_tolerance`** (§1.0 Instrument Units & Notional Invariants)
- **Default**: `0.001` (0.1% relative tolerance)
- **Purpose**: Tolerance for contracts vs amount consistency check when both are provided; prevents wiring bugs.
- **Rationale**: 0.1% tolerates floating-point rounding without masking meaningful mismatches.
AT-280
- Given: `contracts=100` and `amount` deviates by >0.1% from `contracts * contract_multiplier`.
- When: units consistency is evaluated.
- Then: reject + Degraded.
- Pass criteria: rejection + Degraded.
- Fail criteria: intent proceeds or no Degraded.

---

### **A.1.1 Inventory Skew Gate**

**`inventory_skew_k`** (§1.4.2 Inventory Skew Gate)
- **Default**: `0.5`
- **Purpose**: Scaling factor for edge requirement increase when approaching inventory limits.
- **Rationale**: At max inventory (`inventory_bias=1.0`), require 50% higher edge (conservative but tradable).
AT-281
- Given: `inventory_bias=0.9` for a risk-increasing trade.
- When: Inventory Skew adjusts `min_edge_usd`.
- Then: `min_edge_usd` is increased by ~45%.
- Pass criteria: ~45% increase (within tolerance).
- Fail criteria: adjustment materially deviates.

**`inventory_skew_tick_penalty_max`** (§1.4.2 Inventory Skew Gate)
- **Default**: `3` ticks
- **Purpose**: Maximum limit price shift away from touch when near inventory limits.
- **Rationale**: 3 ticks reduces fill rate without making execution impossible; balances inventory control with opportunity cost.
AT-282
- Given: `inventory_bias=1.0` for a BUY.
- When: Inventory Skew adjusts `limit_price`.
- Then: limit price shifts 3 ticks below best ask.
- Pass criteria: 3-tick shift.
- Fail criteria: shift differs.

**`rescue_cross_spread_ticks`** (§1.2 Atomic Group Executor)
- **Default**: `2` ticks
- **Purpose**: How far to cross the spread when placing rescue IOC orders for atomic group containment.
- **Rationale**: 2 ticks provides aggressive fill probability while limiting slippage cost during containment.
- **Semantics**: For BUY rescue: `limit_price = best_ask + (rescue_cross_spread_ticks * tick_size)`; for SELL rescue: `limit_price = best_bid - (rescue_cross_spread_ticks * tick_size)`.
AT-283
- Given: a mixed-state rescue attempt.
- When: rescue IOC limit price is computed.
- Then: limit price is 2 ticks past best bid/ask (BUY crosses ask upward; SELL crosses bid downward).
- Pass criteria: 2-tick cross applied correctly.
- Fail criteria: incorrect cross or tick distance.

---

### **A.2 Reflexive Cortex (Microstructure Collapse)**

**`spread_max_bps`** (§2.3 Reflexive Cortex)
- **Default**: `25` bps
- **Purpose**: Maximum tolerable spread before forcing ReduceOnly
- **Rationale**: Live F1 PASS target tolerates p95 slippage ≤ 10 bps (§8.1). Spreads >2.5× indicate microstructure collapse.
AT-284
- Given: `spread_bps = 26`.
- When: Cortex evaluates `MarketData`.
- Then: Cortex outputs `ForceReduceOnly{cooldown_s=spread_depth_cooldown_s}` and opens are blocked.
- Pass criteria: ForceReduceOnly issued; opens blocked.
- Fail criteria: no ForceReduceOnly or opens allowed.

**`spread_kill_bps`** (§2.3 Reflexive Cortex)
- **Default**: `75` bps
- **Purpose**: Hard kill threshold for extreme spread blowout
- **Rationale**: 3x `spread_max_bps` indicates market dislocation and unreliable execution.
AT-285
- Given: `spread_bps >= spread_kill_bps` for `cortex_kill_window_s`.
- When: Cortex evaluates `MarketData`.
- Then: Cortex outputs `ForceKill`.
- Pass criteria: ForceKill issued.
- Fail criteria: ForceKill not issued.

**`depth_min`** (§2.3 Cortex, §4.1 SVI)
- **Default**: `300_000` USD
- **Unit**: USD notional depth in top-N price levels (N=5 per side; see §2.3 depth_topN definition).
- **Purpose**: Minimum depth threshold; below triggers ReduceOnly (Cortex) and loosened SVI gates
- **Rationale**: Contract uses `notional_usd=30_000` as worked example (§1.0). 10× ensures "low depth" means thin markets.
- **Behavior**: Cortex \u2192 ReduceOnly; SVI \u2192 drift 20%→40%, RMSE 0.05→0.08
AT-286
- Given: `depth_topN = 299_999`.
- When: Cortex evaluates `MarketData`.
- Then: Cortex outputs `ForceReduceOnly`.
- Pass criteria: ForceReduceOnly issued.
- Fail criteria: ForceReduceOnly not issued.

AT-287
- Given: `depth_topN = 299_999`.
- When: SVI gate evaluates a low-depth fit.
- Then: SVI applies 40% drift max and 0.08 RMSE max.
- Pass criteria: loosened thresholds applied.
- Fail criteria: thresholds not loosened.

**`depth_kill_min`** (§2.3 Reflexive Cortex)
- **Default**: `100_000` USD
- **Unit**: USD notional depth in top-N price levels (N=5 per side; see §2.3 depth_topN definition).
- **Purpose**: Hard kill threshold for extreme depth depletion.
- **Rationale**: One-third of `depth_min` indicates a broken book.
AT-288
- Given: `depth_topN <= depth_kill_min` for `cortex_kill_window_s`.
- When: Cortex evaluates `MarketData`.
- Then: Cortex outputs `ForceKill`.
- Pass criteria: ForceKill issued.
- Fail criteria: ForceKill not issued.

**`cortex_kill_window_s`** (§2.3 Reflexive Cortex)
- **Default**: `10` seconds
- **Purpose**: Continuous breach window to trigger ForceKill.
- **Rationale**: Prevents flapping on transient spread/depth spikes.
AT-289
- Given: breach persists 9s and then 10s.
- When: Cortex evaluates the kill window.
- Then: no trip at 9s; `ForceKill` at 10s.
- Pass criteria: trip only at >= `cortex_kill_window_s`.
- Fail criteria: trip early or not at threshold.

**`dvol_jump_pct`** (§2.3 Reflexive Cortex)
- **Default**: `0.10` (10%)
- **Purpose**: DVOL jump threshold triggering ReduceOnly (volatility shock detection).
- **Rationale**: 10% intra-minute DVOL spike signals market stress or regime shift; halts opens until cooldown expires.
AT-290
- Given: DVOL increases by ≥10% within 60s.
- When: Cortex evaluates `MarketData`.
- Then: Cortex outputs `ForceReduceOnly{cooldown_s=dvol_cooldown_s}`.
- Pass criteria: ForceReduceOnly issued with cooldown `dvol_cooldown_s`.
- Fail criteria: no ForceReduceOnly.

**`dvol_jump_window_s`** (§2.3 Reflexive Cortex)
- **Default**: `60` seconds
- **Purpose**: Rolling window for DVOL jump detection.
- **Rationale**: 60s captures intra-minute volatility shocks while filtering tick-level noise.
AT-291
- Given: DVOL jump from 0.50 to 0.55 over 61s, then over 59s.
- When: Cortex evaluates the window.

**`parquet_queue_clear_pct`** (§2.2.2 EvidenceGuard)
- **Default**: `0.70` (70%)
- **Purpose**: Queue depth hysteresis threshold for returning to GREEN.
- **Rationale**: 20% hysteresis band (90% trip, 70% clear) prevents oscillation.
AT-309
- Given: queue depth drops below 70%.
- When: clear window is evaluated.
- Then: queue must remain below 70% for ≥ `queue_clear_window_s` before GREEN restored.
- Pass criteria: GREEN restored only after window.

AT-312
- Given: `disk_used_pct >= 0.85`.
- When: disk watermark logic runs.
- Then: `RiskState::Degraded`; ReduceOnly until back under 0.80; reclaim runs.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly enforced; reclaim triggered.
- Fail criteria: remains Active or no reclaim.

**`disk_kill_pct`** (§7.2 Disk Watermarks)
- **Default**: `0.92`
- **Purpose**: Disk usage threshold triggering `TradingMode::Kill` and forcing **containment-only** operation (no new exposure) until net exposure is neutral.
- **Rationale**: At ≥92% disk usage, the system treats persistence/audit subsystems as unsafe. The contract is **integrity-first for new risk creation** (OPENs blocked), but **capital-supremacy-first for existing exposure** (risk-reducing containment dispatch remains permitted while exposed). After exposure is neutral, the system MAY hard-stop dispatch until disk usage returns below `disk_degraded_pct` (or until manual intervention).

AT-313
- Given: `disk_used_pct >= 0.92` AND net exposure ≠ 0.
- When: disk watermark logic runs and TradingMode is resolved.
- Then: `TradingMode == Kill`; OPEN intents are blocked; containment dispatch attempts are permitted/attempted (§2.2.3.6).
- Pass criteria: OPEN dispatch count remains 0; at least one risk-reducing dispatch attempt occurs while exposure ≠ 0.
- Fail criteria: any OPEN dispatch occurs, or the system hard-stops with exposure by forbidding all dispatch.
Profile: CSP
**`time_drift_threshold_ms`** (§4.3 Trade Attribution Schema)
- **Default**: `50` milliseconds
- **Purpose**: Maximum tolerable clock drift before forcing ReduceOnly; prevents attribution corruption and execution timing errors.
- **Rationale**: Aligns with §8.1 Time Drift gate (p99_clock_drift ≤ 50ms). Tight threshold ensures reliable timestamps for slippage measurement and replay.

- Given: `drift_ms > 50ms`.
- When: time drift gate evaluates.
- Then: PolicyGuard forces ReduceOnly until time sync restored.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly enforced during drift.
- Fail criteria: remains Active.

**`max_policy_age_sec`** (§2.2.3 PolicyGuard)
- **Default**: `300` seconds (5 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Maximum policy staleness before forcing ReduceOnly; prevents trading on stale/outdated policy.
- **Rationale**: Aligned with ops alert threshold (§7.1). 5min provides reasonable tolerance for transient Commander hiccups while preventing drift.
AT-315
- Given: `policy_age_sec > 300`.
- When: PolicyGuard evaluates staleness.
- Then: ReduceOnly enforced until fresh policy received.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly enforced.
- Fail criteria: remains Active.

**`close_buffer_ticks`** (§3.1 Deterministic Emergency Close)
- **Default**: `5` ticks
- **Purpose**: Initial spread buffer for emergency IOC close orders (in ticks from best price).
- **Rationale**: 5 ticks respects instrument microstructure (BTC-10k vs ETH-1k have different tick regimes); exponential retry provides fallback.
AT-316
- Given: emergency close attempts 1, 2, 3.
- When: close prices are computed.
- Then: attempt 1 uses `best ± 5 ticks`; retry 2 uses ~10 ticks; retry 3 uses ~20 ticks.
- Pass criteria: tick buffers scale as specified.

AT-317
- Given: L2 walk estimates `slippage_bps > 10`.
- When: Liquidity Gate evaluates.
- Then: trade is rejected before dispatch.
- Pass criteria: rejection occurs pre-dispatch.
- Fail criteria: trade proceeds.

- When: fee estimates are computed.
- Then: apply 20% buffer to fee rates.
- Pass criteria: buffer applied.
- Fail criteria: buffer missing.

**`fee_cache_hard_s`** (§4.2 Fee-Aware Execution)
- **Default**: `900` seconds (15 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Hard threshold for fee model staleness; triggers Degraded + ReduceOnly.
- **Rationale**: 3× soft limit provides ample warning; 15min stale fee data is unacceptable for edge calculations.
AT-319
- Given: fee cache age > 900s.
- When: PolicyGuard evaluates.
- Then: `RiskState::Degraded`; OPEN blocked.
- Pass criteria: ReduceOnly enforced; OPEN blocked.

Profile: GOP

**`decision_snapshot_retention_days`** (§7.2 Retention Policy)
- **Default**: `30` days
- **Purpose**: Rolling retention window for Decision Snapshot partitions (replay input).
- **Rationale**: 30 days provides sufficient history for Governor tuning and incident analysis while managing storage costs.
- **Safety Invariant**: `decision_snapshot_retention_days >= ceil(replay_window_hours / 24)` (must cover replay window; default 48h → 2 days).
AT-323
- Given: Decision Snapshots older than 30 days and snapshots within the replay window.
- When: retention reclaim runs.
- Then: older snapshots are eligible for deletion (cold partitions only); replay-window snapshots MUST NOT be deleted.

## **Appendix CSP: Core Safety Contract (CSP) — Extracted, Self-Contained**

Profile: CSP

This appendix is an extracted restatement of the **Core Safety Profile (CSP)** runtime safety requirements.

**Normative intent:** A system that satisfies every requirement in this appendix, **and** satisfies the CSP enforcement mechanics in §0.Z.5–§0.Z.9 (profile tagging, declaration of compliance, profile isolation, and CSP_ONLY CI gate), **and** passes all `Profile: CSP` acceptance tests, is **SAFE TO TRADE** — even if governance/analytics/optimization subsystems are absent, degraded, or disabled.

### **CSP.0 Scope**

This appendix applies when either:
- the implementation claims `supported_profiles` includes CSP, or
- the running deployment reports `/api/v1/status.enforced_profile == CSP`.

When `enforced_profile == CSP`, all GOP-only subsystems are out of scope and MUST NOT be required for correctness or liveness.

### **CSP.1 Definitions (Self-Contained)**

The following definitions are authoritative within this appendix:

- **Intent**: an internal request that may result in one or more exchange API calls (place order, cancel order, amend order, close/hedge action).

- **Risk-Increasing Intent (OPEN)**: any intent that can increase net exposure (including any order placement where `reduce_only != true`, or any unclassifiable intent).  
  **Fail-closed classification rule:** if an intent cannot be proven risk-reducing, it MUST be treated as OPEN.

- **Risk-Reducing Intent (CLOSE/HEDGE)**: any intent that is provably monotonic-reducing with respect to exposure, including:
  - orders with `reduce_only == true`, and/or
  - cancel requests, and/or
  - emergency containment actions whose objective is to reduce net exposure.

- **Dispatch**: an outbound network attempt to the venue (REST, WS-RPC, or other venue API) that may place/amend/cancel an order.

- **RecordedBeforeDispatch**: the property that a risk-increasing intent has been recorded before dispatch according to §2.4:
  - the intent has been accepted by the WAL append path (bounded in-memory WAL queue enqueue succeeds) before any dispatch attempt, and
  - the hot loop does not block on WAL disk I/O.

- **DurableBeforeDispatch**: the property that a configured durability barrier (fsync marker or equivalent) has been reached before dispatch when a subsystem requires it (§2.4).

- **WAL (Write-Ahead Log)**: the append-only intent ledger that is persisted to a crash-safe store. `RecordedBeforeDispatch` corresponds to successful enqueue into the WAL writer queue (§2.4.1); `DurableBeforeDispatch` corresponds to reaching the configured durability barrier before dispatch (§2.4).

- **Reconciliation**: the post-restart (or post-gap) procedure that joins:
  - WAL intents,
  - venue open orders,
  - venue trades/fills,
  - venue positions,
  and proves which intents were sent/filled vs not.

- **OpenPermissionLatch**: a fail-closed latch that blocks OPEN dispatch after:
  - process restart,
  - WS gap / sequencing gap,
  - session termination / auth reset,
  until reconciliation completes.

- **TradingMode**: the enforcement layer with states:
  - `Active` (OPEN permitted if all gates pass),
  - `ReduceOnly` (OPEN forbidden; risk-reducing actions permitted),
  - `Kill` (risk-increasing actions forbidden; only risk-reducing actions permitted).

- **staleness_clock_ms**: the authoritative monotonic time source used for interval comparisons in safety-critical freshness checks.

### **CSP.2 Idempotency & Deduplication**

#### **CSP.2.1 Stable Intent Identity**

Every outbound intent that may result in dispatch MUST be uniquely identifiable and deduplicable across:
- retries,
- reconnects,
- process restarts.

Idempotency keys MUST:
- be derived solely from deterministic intent identity fields (e.g., `group_id`, `leg_idx`, `intent_hash`, strategy/policy identifiers where applicable),
- NOT depend on wall-clock time, RNG, or process-local counters.

#### **CSP.2.2 Deduplication Rule**

Duplicate dispatch attempts MUST NOT result in additional exposure.

The system MUST deduplicate at minimum across:
- client retry loops,
- WS reconnect replay,
- restart replay/reconciliation.

### **CSP.3 RecordedBeforeDispatch (WAL)**

#### **CSP.3.1 Mandatory Recording for OPEN**

Every OPEN intent MUST satisfy RecordedBeforeDispatch before any dispatch attempt.

Failure to satisfy RecordedBeforeDispatch MUST fail-closed:
- the OPEN must be blocked, and
- a deterministic reason MUST be surfaced.

#### **CSP.3.2 WAL Degradation Semantics**

WAL failure MAY block OPEN.

WAL failure MUST NOT block:
- CANCEL intents,
- CLOSE/HEDGE intents,
- emergency containment.

### **CSP.4 Restart, Gaps, and Reconciliation**

#### **CSP.4.1 Restart Safety**

On restart, the system MUST reconcile:
- WAL intents,
- venue open orders,
- venue trades,
- venue positions.

#### **CSP.4.2 No Duplicate Sends**

No intent MAY be re-sent unless reconciliation proves it unsent or safe to re-issue by idempotency identity.

#### **CSP.4.3 WS Gap / Session Termination**

On WS sequencing gap, WS disconnect with unknown replay continuity, or session termination:
- the OpenPermissionLatch MUST engage and block OPEN,
- risk-reducing intents (CANCEL/CLOSE/HEDGE) MUST remain permitted (subject to venue reachability),
- the latch MUST clear only after reconciliation succeeds.

### **CSP.5 TradingMode Semantics & Enforcement**

#### **CSP.5.1 Modes**

TradingMode ∈ { `Active`, `ReduceOnly`, `Kill` }.

TradingMode MUST be computed deterministically (panic-free) at a bounded cadence (each loop tick or equivalent).

#### **CSP.5.2 Enforcement Rules**

- OPEN intents MAY dispatch only when TradingMode is `Active` AND OpenPermissionLatch is clear AND RecordedBeforeDispatch is satisfied.
- In `ReduceOnly`:
  - OPEN is forbidden,
  - risk-reducing actions (CANCEL/CLOSE/HEDGE) are permitted.
- In `Kill`:
  - OPEN and any risk-increasing action are forbidden,
  - only risk-reducing actions are permitted.

#### **CSP.5.3 Safety-Critical Prerequisite: Runtime F1 Certification Gate**

A runtime F1 certification state (F1_CERT) MUST be enforced such that:
- missing/stale/invalid/mismatched F1_CERT → TradingMode MUST be at most `ReduceOnly` (OPEN blocked; risk-reducing actions permitted).
- F1_CERT failures MUST be treated as CSP safety inputs (not governance inputs).

(Implementation details are venue- and repo-specific; the observable enforcement semantics above are the CSP requirement.)

### **CSP.6 Capital Supremacy (No Stranded Exposure)**

If net exposure is non-zero **or unknown**, the system MUST define at least one legal risk-reducing action path.

The following state is forbidden:

- exposure ≠ 0 (or exposure unknown), AND
- all CLOSE/HEDGE/emergency containment actions are blocked by internal policy.

This invariant applies even under `Kill` or degraded infrastructure conditions. If competing rules would forbid all risk-reduction, the implementation MUST prefer a deterministic risk-reducing action path (fail-safe).

### **CSP.7 Deterministic Emergency Containment**

A deterministic emergency containment mechanism MUST exist.

Emergency containment MUST be callable in:
- `ReduceOnly`,
- `Kill`,
- degraded infrastructure states.

Emergency containment MUST be:
- bounded (finite retries / bounded time),
- deterministic (no unbounded oscillation),
- monotonic with respect to exposure (never increases risk).

### **CSP.8 Timebase Authority (Safety-Critical)**

All interval-based freshness / staleness checks that affect TradingMode, OpenPermissionLatch, or OPEN legality MUST use a monotonic timebase for interval measurement.

Wall-clock time MAY be recorded for observability, but MUST NOT be used as the authoritative basis for interval comparisons that trigger `Kill`.

Clock uncertainty MAY force `ReduceOnly`, but MUST NOT force `Kill`.

### **CSP.9 Profile Isolation**

When `/api/v1/status.enforced_profile == CSP`, the system MUST treat all GOP-only subsystems as nonexistent inputs.

In particular, the following MUST NOT influence any CSP safety-critical decision:
- EvidenceChainState / EvidenceGuard,
- TruthCapsule and Decision Snapshot writers (presence, health, lag, queue depth),
- Replay Gatekeeper results,
- Canary rollout governor state,
- Optimization loop state.

GOP failures under CSP enforcement MAY be surfaced, but MUST NOT change:
- TradingMode,
- OpenPermissionLatch,
- legality of risk-reducing actions,
- idempotency or reconciliation behavior.

### **CSP.10 CSP_ONLY Build/Test Mode (Mechanically Enforced)**

The repo MUST support a build configuration in which GOP-only code is physically absent (`CSP_ONLY build`).

In a CSP_ONLY build:
- GOP-only modules MUST NOT be linked,
- GOP-only dependencies MUST be feature-gated,
- the resulting binary MUST be capable of live trading under CSP.

CI MUST prove CSP isolation by running, at minimum:
- `build:csp_only` (CSP_ONLY build must succeed),
- `test:csp_only` (all `Profile: CSP` acceptance tests must pass in CSP_ONLY mode),
- `test:gop` (runs `Profile: GOP` tests with GOP enabled; failures disable GOP but do not block CSP deployments).

### **CSP.11 Explicit Non-Requirements**

The following are NOT REQUIRED for CSP compliance:
- TruthCapsule persistence,
- Decision Snapshot persistence,
- EvidenceChainState / EvidenceGuard,
- Replay simulation and replay gatekeeping,
- Canary rollout governance,
- optimization loops,
- attribution completeness beyond correctness needs.

Failure or absence of the above MUST NOT, by itself, violate CSP invariants.

### **CSP.12 Acceptance Tests**

All acceptance tests tagged `Profile: CSP` are mandatory for any implementation that trades live.

Failure of any CSP-tagged test MUST block deployment (and/or force trading halt, per implementation policy).

## **Appendix CSP-MAP: Traceability Matrix (Appendix CSP → Canonical Sections/ATs)**
Profile: CSP

**Status:** Informative (non-normative)

This appendix is a **navigation / traceability aid**. It maps each clause in **Appendix CSP** to the primary
definition points in the main contract and to the most directly relevant acceptance tests.

- The mappings below are **non-exhaustive** by design (they point you at the “load-bearing” ATs/sections first).
- In case of any conflict, the **numbered sections** and **Appendix CSP** remain controlling; this appendix does not
  create new requirements.
