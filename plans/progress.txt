- Summary: Hardened Phase-0 gating with semantic PAPER non-trading checks in `tools/phase0_meta_test.py`; clarified Phase-0 health enforcement scope in `docs/ROADMAP.md`; backfilled deferred runtime identity-probe ticket in `plans/ideas.md`.
- Commands: python3 tools/phase0_meta_test.py --root .; ./plans/verify.sh quick.
- Evidence: tools/phase0_meta_test.py; docs/ROADMAP.md; plans/ideas.md; verify artifacts from latest run.
- Story: workflow/phase0-canonical-checklist-alignment
- Date: 2026-02-10
- Summary: Re-verified after Phase-0 semantic PAPER gate + ROADMAP clarification changes; full verify is green.
- Commands: ./plans/verify.sh full.
- Evidence: artifacts/verify/20260209_180018; tools/phase0_meta_test.py; docs/ROADMAP.md; plans/ideas.md.
- Notes: Working tree remained dirty from unrelated local changes; no VERIFY_ALLOW_DIRTY override used.
- Story: workflow/phase0-canonical-checklist-alignment
- Date: 2026-02-10 01:09:39 UTC
- Summary: Implemented all requested follow-ups: executable health command gate, machine-readable policy path + strict loader baseline, and split unrelated local dirty files into stash.
- Commands: git stash push -u -m "split-unrelated-local-dirty-2026-02-10" -- plans/codex_review_logged.sh plans/tests/test_workflow_allowlist_coverage.sh plans/workflow_files_allowlist.txt plans/workflow_verify.sh specs/WORKFLOW_CONTRACT.md .worktrees/prd-rest-slices plans/kimi_review_logged.sh; python3 scripts/build_contract_kernel.py; python3 tools/phase0_meta_test.py --root .; ./plans/verify.sh quick; ./plans/verify.sh full.

- Notes: Stash created for unrelated local edits: stash@{0} "split-unrelated-local-dirty-2026-02-10". Local ignore updated at `.git/info/exclude` for `.worktrees/` so nested worktree path no longer pollutes status.
Story: workflow/phase0-runtime-automation
Date: 2026-02-10
Summary: Added executable Phase-0 runtime automation coverage in `crates/soldier_infra/tests/test_phase0_runtime.rs` and wired meta-check requirements/docs references for runtime test presence. Verified policy fail-closed, key least-privilege fail-closed, and break-glass OPEN-block/reduce-allow behavior through `stoic-cli` command paths.

Next: Review and intentionally stage only desired files for commit.
Story: workflow-maintenance
Date: 2026-02-09
Summary: Updated manual story loop to require Kimi K2.5 review at step 5 and a second Codex review at step 6.1; enforced new review evidence requirements in story_review_gate (Kimi artifact + two Codex artifacts + explicit resolution refs); added kimi review logger script and deterministic fixture test; wired new fixture into preflight/workflow maintenance checks and workflow allowlist coverage.

Story: phase0-hardening-status-breakglass
Date: 2026-02-10 02:10:00 UTC
Summary: Implemented all requested follow-ups: aligned break-glass docs to executable CLI behavior, added executable end-to-end break-glass command-path validation, and promoted minimal owner status fields (`trading_mode`, `is_trading_allowed`) into Phase-0 contract/docs/gates. Extended `stoic-cli` with `status`, `orders --pending`, `emergency` mode controls, and drill helpers (`simulate-open`, `simulate-close`); added runtime tests and meta-test enforcement.
Commands: ./stoic-cli --help; python3 tools/phase0_meta_test.py --root .; cargo test -p soldier_infra --test test_phase0_runtime; python3 scripts/build_contract_kernel.py; ./plans/verify.sh quick; ./plans/verify.sh full.

Story: workflow-maintenance
Date: 2026-02-10
Summary: Validated real review loop on story-style branch with logged artifacts and added guardrails for review tooling reliability. Added fixture coverage for codex review logger (bash 3.2 empty-array regression), added canonical review_resolution template, wired new fixture into preflight/allowlist checks, and updated Kimi logger to support CLIs without `kimi review` by falling back to `kimi --print --prompt` mode.
Commands: bash plans/tests/test_codex_review_logged.sh; bash plans/tests/test_kimi_review_logged.sh; bash plans/tests/test_story_review_gate.sh; bash plans/tests/test_workflow_allowlist_coverage.sh; ./plans/workflow_contract_gate.sh; ./plans/workflow_verify.sh; ./plans/verify.sh full; ./plans/self_review_logged.sh S9-900 --decision PASS --head <HEAD>; ./plans/codex_review_logged.sh S9-900 --commit HEAD ... (twice); ./plans/kimi_review_logged.sh S9-900 --commit HEAD --model k2.5 ...; ./plans/story_review_gate.sh S9-900 --head <HEAD>.
Evidence: plans/tests/test_codex_review_logged.sh; plans/tests/test_kimi_review_logged.sh; plans/preflight.sh; plans/kimi_review_logged.sh; plans/review_resolution_template.md; plans/story_review_gate.sh; plans/workflow_files_allowlist.txt; plans/tests/test_workflow_allowlist_coverage.sh; artifacts/story/S9-900/{self_review,codex,kimi,review_resolution.md}; artifacts/verify/20260210_075155; artifacts/verify/20260210_075429.
Notes: Real Kimi CLI in this environment does not provide `review` subcommand and reports `LLM not set` in print mode until model/auth config is set; artifact logging and gate wiring still execute deterministically.
Next: Configure Kimi CLI model/auth for non-empty review outputs in real runs.
Story: workflow-maintenance
Date: 2026-02-10
Summary: Completed recommended follow-up #1 in real environment by configuring local Kimi model alias `k2.5` in `~/.kimi/config.toml` (mapped to existing `managed:kimi-code` model), reran real `plans/kimi_review_logged.sh` for `S9-900`, and revalidated review evidence gate for the reviewed commit SHA.
Commands: kimi --print --model k2.5 --prompt "Return exactly: K2_5_CONFIGURED"; ./plans/kimi_review_logged.sh S9-900 --commit HEAD --model k2.5 --title "S9-900: real kimi review (k2.5 configured)"; ./plans/story_review_gate.sh S9-900 --head 13bc36195e1cfcbb36069c9e872437f559f00c82.
Evidence: artifacts/story/S9-900/kimi/20260210T141106Z_review.md; artifacts/story/S9-900/review_resolution.md.
Notes: Current branch HEAD moved to f8eec3 while S9-900 review artifacts are tied to 13bc361; gate revalidation intentionally pinned `--head` to reviewed commit for consistency.
Next: If S9-900 must represent current HEAD f8eec3, regenerate full self+codex+kimi review set for that SHA.
Story: workflow/phase0-canonical-checklist-alignment
Date: 2026-02-10
Summary: Hardened external runtime-state escape hatch semantics in `stoic-cli`: added explicit runtime-state visibility (`runtime_state_path`, `external_runtime_state`, warning surface), required two-key opt-in for external runtime state on mutating commands (`emergency`, `simulate-open`, `simulate-close`), and expanded Phase-0 coverage/docs accordingly. Also hardened meta-test runtime-state fallback to handle read-only/permission-limited filesystems deterministically.
Commands: python3 -m py_compile stoic-cli tools/phase0_meta_test.py; cargo test -p soldier_infra --test test_phase0_runtime; python3 tools/phase0_meta_test.py --root .; cargo fmt; ./plans/verify.sh quick; ./plans/verify.sh full.

Notes: `./plans/verify.sh quick` initially failed only on rustfmt diff in `test_phase0_runtime.rs`; rerun passed after `cargo fmt`. Verify ran with default dirty-tree warning and without `VERIFY_ALLOW_DIRTY`.
Next: None.
Story: workflow/phase0-followup-regression-fixes
Date: 2026-02-10
Summary: Applied forensic follow-up fixes for PR #18 regressions: restored transfer least-privilege checks in `stoic-cli keys-check` (transfer_enabled flag, transfer scope ban, transfer success rejection), restored runtime-state parent-directory fsync after atomic rename, and added regression tests for future-dated L2 fail-closed behavior, transfer privilege rejection, and fsync durability anchor.
Commands: cargo test -p soldier_core --test test_liquidity_gate test_future_dated_l2_rejected_fail_closed; cargo test -p soldier_infra --test test_phase0_runtime test_api_keys_transfer_privilege_rejected_runtime; cargo test -p soldier_infra --test test_phase0_runtime test_runtime_state_writer_fsyncs_parent_directory; cargo test -p soldier_core --test test_liquidity_gate; cargo test -p soldier_infra --test test_phase0_runtime; python3 -m py_compile stoic-cli; ./plans/verify.sh quick.

Notes: verify quick passed with dirty-tree warning only.
Next: Optional: add a small dedicated guard script that asserts key `stoic-cli` security anchors to catch merge rollbacks even earlier in preflight.
Story: workflow/phase0-followup-regression-fixes
Date: 2026-02-10
Summary: Implemented requested follow-ups (1) and (2): added deterministic `plans/stoic_cli_invariant_check.sh` guard for critical `stoic-cli` security/durability anchors (transfer least-privilege checks + post-rename directory fsync), wired it into `plans/preflight.sh` + `plans/workflow_verify.sh`, added fixture coverage `plans/tests/test_stoic_cli_invariant_check.sh`, updated workflow allowlist coverage, and added checklist item in `reviews/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` for merge-rollback audit of these anchors.

Story: workflow-maintenance
Date: 2026-02-10
Summary: Closed review findings by (1) enforcing code-review-expert quality at story gate (HEAD match + Review Status COMPLETE + placeholder rejection), (2) making full verify enforce slice-close thinking review on run/sliceN-clean once all slice stories are passes=true via slice_completion_enforce, and (3) de-flaking code-review-expert logger fixtures by parsing explicit emitted artifact paths.
