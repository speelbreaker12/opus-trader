# Workflow Skill Memory (Manual)

Purpose
- Capture recurring corrections and preferred patterns for the workflow harness.
- Manual-only; no automation. Update when a pattern repeats.

Usage policy
- Read before starting any task.
- Update only when a new repeated pattern is discovered (manual judgment).
- Keep it versioned and lightweight; no new gates or automation.

How to use
- Add an entry only after it has happened at least twice.
- Keep entries short, specific, and testable.
- Prefer “Do/Don’t” phrasing with an example.

## Rules (Stable)
- [x] Rule:
  - Do: Use `docs/PHASE1_CHECKLIST_BLOCK.md` first and `docs/ROADMAP.md` second for Phase 1 gating decisions.
  - Don't: Treat excerpt/reference docs as decision authority for pass/block calls.
  - Example: Before marking a P1 gate complete, check unblock conditions in `docs/PHASE1_CHECKLIST_BLOCK.md`, then use `docs/ROADMAP.md` for context wording only.
