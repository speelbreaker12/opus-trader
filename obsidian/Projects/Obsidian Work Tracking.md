## Log
### 2026-03-16
- Created vault structure: Projects/, Debriefs/, Templates/, archive/
- Created Project template with frontmatter (status, priority, branch, pr, started)
- Created Debrief template with TOC format (shipped, constraint, follow-up, rules)
- Seeded 4 project files from memory (Autoresearch, Tmatic, Execution Facade, Phase 1)
- Built obsidian-context-hook.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook, shows active projects every message
- Built obsidian-precommit-hook.sh — PreToolUse hook, blocks git commit unless project file updated
- Made precommit hook mandatory (exit 2), lists existing projects, includes inline template for new ones
- Registered both hooks in .claude/settings.json
