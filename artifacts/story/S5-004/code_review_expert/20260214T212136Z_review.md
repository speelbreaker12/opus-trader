- Review Status: COMPLETE
- Title: S5-004: failure-mode guards code review

## Findings
- Blocking: none
- Major: none
- Medium: none

## Review Details

### SOLID / Design
- Single Responsibility: each fix is isolated to one function/module, no cross-cutting concerns
- Open/Closed: new RejectReasonCode variants are additive, old variants retained
- Interface Segregation: no new public APIs, only guards added to existing functions

### Security
- No command injection, XSS, or SQL injection vectors (Rust crate, no web surface)
- NaN/Inf/overflow inputs validated at function boundaries (fail-closed)
- No unwrap() in production code paths

### Test Coverage
- 33 new tests across 12 test files
- Boundary conditions tested (soft/hard thresholds, zero values, terminal states)
- Exhaustive TLSM sync test covers all state×event combinations

## Actions
- Tests added from top findings: TLSM whitelist sync test, fee_rate=0.0 edge cases
- Fixes applied: all review findings addressed

## Final Disposition
- Remaining findings: BLOCKING=0 MAJOR=0 MEDIUM=0
