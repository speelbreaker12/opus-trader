Decision: PASS

Checklist:
- Failure-Mode Review: DONE
- Strategic Failure Review: DONE
- Contract alignment checked: YES
- Acceptance criteria met: YES

## Failure-Mode Review Notes
- Preserved concrete WAL gate error strings in Gate 9 rejection payloads.
- Removed unbounded in-memory WAL event growth from runtime ledger state.
- Updated stale PRD evidence reference to match active crash/restart test naming.

## Strategic Failure Review Notes
- Kept scope minimal to inline review findings and avoided cross-slice refactors.
- Chose bounded/non-blocking WAL write behavior to maintain writer isolation intent.

## Risks / Follow-ups
- Monitor restart durability behavior in CI for file-backed WAL paths.
