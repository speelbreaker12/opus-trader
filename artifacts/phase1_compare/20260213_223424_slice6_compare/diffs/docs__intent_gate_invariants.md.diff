 ## Normative Ordering Constraints
 
-### C1: Reject Before Persist
+1. **Reject before persist:** If any gate or authorization rejects an OPEN intent, the system MUST NOT attempt WAL recording or any dispatch side effects.
+2. **WAL before dispatch:** For any OPEN intent that is allowed, the intent MUST be recorded (RecordedBeforeDispatch) before any network dispatch attempt.
+3. **Side effects after accept:** Record and dispatch side effects MUST occur only after all gates succeed; a record failure MUST block dispatch.
 
-All validation gates (DispatchAuth, Preflight, Quantize, FeeCacheCheck, LiquidityGate, NetEdgeGate, Pricer) **must** execute before RecordedBeforeDispatch (WAL append).
+## Contract References
 
-**Rationale:** If we persist an intent to WAL before validating it, a crash after WAL write but before rejection would leave an invalid intent in the log, requiring reconciliation of something that should never have been recorded.
-
-### C2: WAL Before Dispatch
-
-RecordedBeforeDispatch (WAL append) is always the **last** gate before the intent is approved for dispatch to the exchange. No dispatch may occur without a prior WAL entry.
-
-**Rationale:** CONTRACT.md RecordedBeforeDispatch — if the process crashes after dispatch but before WAL write, the system cannot reconcile the exchange state on restart. WAL-first guarantees crash recovery can detect all dispatched intents.
-
-### C3: No Side Effects Before Accept
-
-An intent is only approved (ChokeResult::Approved) when **all** gates pass. If any single gate fails, the result is ChokeResult::Rejected. The gate trace stops at the failing gate — no subsequent gates execute.
-
-**Rationale:** Partial execution of the gate pipeline could create inconsistent state. Early-exit on failure ensures rejected intents produce zero persistent side effects (proven by S6-002 tests).

-## Gate Ordering (Deterministic)
-
-```
-1. DispatchAuth     — RiskState check (OPEN requires Healthy)
-2. Preflight        — Order type validation
-3. Quantize         — Lot size quantization
-4. FeeCacheCheck    — Fee cache staleness
-5. LiquidityGate    — Book-walk slippage (OPEN only)
-6. NetEdgeGate      — Fee + slippage vs min_edge (OPEN only)
-7. Pricer           — IOC limit price clamping (OPEN only)
-8. RecordedBeforeDispatch — WAL append (LAST, always)

-Tests in `crates/soldier_core/tests/test_gate_ordering.rs` enforce:
-- C1: `test_constraint_reject_gates_before_persist`
-- C2: `test_constraint_wal_is_last_gate_{open,close,hedge}`
-- C3: `test_constraint_no_approval_with_any_gate_failed`
-- Trace stops at failure: `test_constraint_rejected_trace_stops_at_failure`
-- WAL after all validation: `test_constraint_wal_after_all_validation_gates`
