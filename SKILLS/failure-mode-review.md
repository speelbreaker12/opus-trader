# SKILL: /failure-mode-review

Purpose
- Find how code will fail, not just whether it looks correct
- Adversarial analysis for caching, state, integrations, error paths (implementation-level)
- Complements `/pr-review` for risky code patterns and `/plan-review` for design-level risks
- For architectural/systemic/operational analysis, use `/strategic-failure-review` after this skill

When to use
- New caching/persistence logic
- Cross-script/cross-module integrations
- State machines or lifecycle management
- Code that handles external inputs (files, env vars, JSON)
- Scripts that might run concurrently (CI, multiple terminals)
- Aggregation/merge operations (are all inputs present?)
- Any code where "it looks right" isn't enough

When NOT to use
- Simple single-file changes with no external dependencies
- Documentation-only changes
- Use `/pr-review` for general correctness checks first

## Review Process

### 1. Interface Crossing Verification

For every call that crosses file/module boundaries:

```bash
# Pattern: script A sets env var, script B reads it
# In script A:
AUDIT_SLICE="$slice" ./other_script.sh

# MUST verify: open other_script.sh, grep for the variable name
grep -n 'AUDIT_SLICE\|PRD_SLICE' other_script.sh
```

Checklist:
- [ ] For each env var passed: read consumer, verify expected name matches
- [ ] For each function call across files: verify parameter names and types
- [ ] For each file path: verify producer and consumer agree on location/format
- [ ] For each JSON field: verify writer and reader use same key name and type

### 2. State Transition Enumeration

For any caching, persistence, or stateful logic, explicitly enumerate:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What creates the artifact? | |
| What reads/uses it? | |
| What invalidates/deletes it? | |
| What if source changes but artifact remains? | |
| What if source disappears but artifact remains? | |
| What if artifact is corrupted/partial/empty? | |
| What if artifact has wrong schema version? | |

Write these out before concluding the cache logic is correct.

### 3. "What If" Analysis

For each external input (file read, env var, JSON field, CLI arg):

| Input | Missing? | Malformed? | Wrong type? | Stale? | Empty? |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| `$ENV_VAR` | | | | | |
| `config.json` | | | | | |
| `field.value` | | | | | |

Ask each question explicitly. Don't assume inputs are valid.

**Exhaustive Type Coverage**: For type-checking code, enumerate ALL types the source can produce:

```python
# JSON can produce: int, float, str, bool, None, list, dict
def to_int(value):
    if isinstance(value, int):
        return value
    if isinstance(value, str):
        return int(value)
    return None  # What about float? bool? None?

# BAD: 1.0 (float) → None → UNKNOWN → cache disabled
# FIX: Handle all JSON numeric types
def to_int(value):
    if isinstance(value, (int, float)):
        return int(value)
    if isinstance(value, str):
        return int(value)
    return None
```

Checklist for type handling:
- [ ] JSON fields: handled `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `None`, `list`, `dict`?
- [ ] Python numbers: handled both `int` and `float`?
- [ ] Empty values: handled `""`, `[]`, `{}`, `None`, `0`?

### 4. Error Path Tracing

For each error handling pattern:

```bash
# Pattern: silent failure
command || true
# ASK: Is silent failure safe here? What state is left behind?

# Pattern: fallback default
value="${VAR:-default}"
# ASK: Is this fail-closed (safe default) or fail-open (dangerous default)?

# Pattern: error return
if error:
    return "UNKNOWN"
# ASK: What does the caller do with "UNKNOWN"? Trace it.
```

Checklist:
- [ ] For each error return: trace what caller does with it
- [ ] For each fallback/default: is it fail-closed or fail-open?
- [ ] For each `|| true`, `except: pass`, `.ok()`: is silent failure safe?
- [ ] For each early return: what cleanup is skipped?

**Persistent Error States**: When error handling returns a sentinel value, ask "what if the error persists across runs?"

```python
def stable_digest_hash(path: Path) -> str:
    if not path.exists():
        return "ABSENT"
    try:
        data = json.loads(path.read_text())
        return sha256(data)
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, OSError):
        return "ERROR"  # Sentinel on parse failure

# Problem: if digest file stays corrupt across runs:
# Run 1: corrupt → "ERROR" → cache key includes "ERROR"
# Run 2: still corrupt → "ERROR" → same cache key → FALSE CACHE HIT!
#
# The sentinel is STABLE, so cache thinks inputs haven't changed
```

Checklist for sentinel values:
- [ ] If error returns sentinel (e.g., "ERROR", "UNKNOWN", -1): what if condition persists?
- [ ] Does stable sentinel cause false cache hits?
- [ ] Should persistent errors FAIL LOUDLY instead of returning sentinel?

### 5. Summary/Count Verification

For any counters, lists, or aggregations:

- [ ] Trace all increments AND decrements
- [ ] Trace all additions AND removals
- [ ] Run the math with concrete example values
- [ ] Check: can the count go negative? Exceed expected max?

Example trace:
```
valid_slices starts at [0, 1, 2]
- slice 1 fails validation → added to invalid_slices
- BUT: slice 1 NOT removed from valid_slices
- Summary: total_passed = len(valid_slices) + fresh_passed
- Bug: slice 1 counted twice
```

### 6. Concrete Value Walkthrough

Pick specific concrete values and trace execution:

```
Scenario: slice 2, items A and B, roadmap exists then deleted

1. First run: roadmap exists
   - roadmap_digest.json created with hash X
   - cache entry: {slice_2: {global_sha: includes X}}

2. User deletes ROADMAP.md

3. Second run: roadmap missing
   - roadmap_digest.json still exists (never deleted)
   - global_sha still includes hash X
   - Cache hit! But audit referenced roadmap that no longer exists
   - BUG: stale cache reuse
```

### 7. Concurrent Execution Analysis

Ask: "What if two instances of this script run simultaneously?"

For any shared state (files, cache, database):
- [ ] Is there file locking or atomic operations?
- [ ] Can read-modify-write cause corruption?
- [ ] What if process A reads, process B writes, process A writes?

Example:
```
Process A: read cache → {slice_1: PASS}
Process B: read cache → {slice_1: PASS}
Process A: write cache → {slice_1: PASS, slice_2: PASS}
Process B: write cache → {slice_1: PASS, slice_3: PASS}  # OVERWRITES slice_2!
```

Fix patterns:
- File locking (`flock`)
- Atomic rename (write to temp, rename)
- Process-specific files with merge step

### 8. Completeness Validation

Ask: "Are all expected inputs present, or could some be silently missing?"

For any aggregation or merge operation:
- [ ] What validates that ALL expected items are present?
- [ ] What if one file in a set is missing?
- [ ] Does the code detect gaps or silently omit?

Example:
```python
# BAD: Silently processes whatever exists
for f in glob("audit_slice_*.json"):
    merge(f)

# GOOD: Validates completeness
expected = {0, 1, 2, 3}
found = {extract_slice_num(f) for f in glob("audit_slice_*.json")}
if found != expected:
    raise ValueError(f"Missing slices: {expected - found}")
```

### 9. Downstream Error Propagation

For each `|| true` or error suppression, trace the FULL downstream path:

```bash
# Line 154: slice_prepare fails silently
./plans/prd_slice_prepare.sh || true

# Immediate effect: meta file not created
# Downstream effect (line 267): merge needs meta file for SHA validation
# Final impact: merge fails with cryptic "SHA mismatch" error
```

Checklist:
- [ ] For each suppressed error: what files/state are NOT created?
- [ ] What later code assumes those files exist?
- [ ] Will the error manifest immediately or much later?

### 10. Trusted Files as Adversarial Input

Files written by your code can still be corrupted, edited, or malicious:

- [ ] Cache files: what if paths inside are outside repo?
- [ ] Config files: what if values are malicious?
- [ ] State files: what if schema is from old version?

Example:
```python
# Cache stores a path
cached_path = cache["audit_json"]  # Could be "/etc/passwd"

# Later used in copy
cp "$cached_path" "$output_dir/"  # PATH TRAVERSAL!

# Fix: validate path is within expected directory
if not cached_path.startswith(expected_dir):
    raise ValueError("Invalid cached path")
```

### 11. Operational Concerns

Issues that don't break correctness but cause problems over time:

**Unbounded growth:**
- [ ] Does cache/log/state grow forever?
- [ ] Is there eviction or rotation?
- [ ] What's the growth rate? (O(n) per run? per day?)

**Cross-platform compatibility:**
- [ ] bash version (macOS ships 3.2, `wait -n` needs 4.3+)
- [ ] GNU vs BSD commands (`sed -i`, `grep -P`)
- [ ] Python version assumptions

**Performance degradation:**
- [ ] Does file size grow unbounded?
- [ ] Are there O(n²) patterns that will slow down?

## Common Failure Patterns (Implementation)

| Pattern | Failure Mode | Check |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Env var passing | Name mismatch between setter/getter | Grep both files |
| File caching | Stale artifact after source deletion | Trace cleanup path |
| JSON parsing | Type coercion (`"0"` vs `0`) | Check comparison operators |
| Error returns | Caller ignores/mishandles error value | Trace return usage |
| List/set tracking | Add without remove on failure | Trace both paths |
| Summary counts | Double-counting or missed items | Walk through with values |
| Default values | Fail-open instead of fail-closed | Check if default is safe |
| `|| true` / `except: pass` | Silent failure hides bugs | Ask if silence is safe |
| Concurrent execution | Read-modify-write corruption | Check for file locking |
| Aggregation/merge | Missing items silently omitted | Validate expected vs found |
| Suppressed errors | Downstream failure with cryptic message | Trace full error path |
| Trusted files | Path traversal, schema mismatch | Validate paths and schema |
| Unbounded growth | Performance degradation over time | Check for eviction/rotation |
| Cross-platform | bash 3.2, GNU vs BSD, Python version | Test on target platforms |
| Incomplete type handling | Float `1.0` treated as invalid | Check all JSON types: int, float, str, bool, None |
| Persistent error sentinel | Stable "ERROR" key → false cache hits | Ask "what if error persists across runs?" |
