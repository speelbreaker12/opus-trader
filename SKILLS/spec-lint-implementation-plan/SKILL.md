# Spec-Lint Checklist for IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (Fail-Closed)

### 0) Scope & Authority (2-minute sanity)
* **Single source of truth declared**: Plan explicitly states CONTRACT wins and plan must not weaken contract gates.
* **No strategy edits allowed until safety lint passes** (explicit PR rule).
* **All plan "rollback" guidance is non-bypass**: rollback for safety logic is revert commit, never "turn gate off" or "loosen thresholds."

**Fail if**: any section says rollback = loosening TTLs/thresholds/feature flags for safety gates.

### 1) Split-Brain Detector (primary constraint killer)
**Goal**: eliminate contradictory instructions inside the plan.

* **No conflicting comparators for any gate**: for each thresholded rule, search for >= vs > and <= vs < on the same metric.
  * Example: EvidenceGuard >0.90 must not coexist with >=0.90.
* **No legacy schedule lines survive alongside overrides** (Canary, cooldowns, retention).
* **If you must keep legacy text**, it must be marked `OBSOLETE` + `MUST NOT` be implemented and the obsolete line must not contain a runnable rule (prefer deletion).

**Fail if**: the plan contains two different values/semantics for the same gate anywhere in the doc.

### 2) Gate Canonicalization (make safety computable, not vibes)
For each safety gate section, confirm all four are present:

#### 2.1 Gate Definition
* **Exact inputs named** (metric names / config keys / artifacts).
* **Exact comparator & threshold** (including inclusive/exclusive).
* **Duration semantics** (e.g., "> 0.90 continuously for >=5s").
* **Hysteresis / exit criteria** (e.g., "<0.70 for >=120s").

**Fail if**: any gate says "high/low/stale/degraded" without numerical or boolean criteria.

#### 2.2 Gate Effect
* **Gate outcome is explicit**: Active / ReduceOnly / Kill.
* **Dispatch constraints explicitly stated when relevant**:
  * Disk Kill: no dispatch including close/hedge/cancel
  * Kill containment: allowed only if eligible, else hard-stop
* **Reason codes split**: what goes in `mode_reasons` vs `open_permission_reason_codes` (and explicit exclusions).

**Fail if**: effect is described with narrative words ("should block opens") but not with TradingMode and dispatch rules.

#### 2.3 Precedence & Chokepoint Enforcement
* **Every gate participates in a single precedence ladder** (PolicyGuard), not scattered "local decisions."
* **Plan states the one chokepoint** where opens are allowed/blocked (e.g., "build_order_intent() is the only intent builder and it is guarded by PolicyGuard result + OpenPermission latch").
* **No feature flag can bypass the chokepoint**.

**Fail if**: any section introduces an alternate dispatch path ("temporary bypass") or "manual override" without contract-defined approvals.

#### 2.4 Test Proof
* **Every MUST / MUST NOT has an explicit test name** or measurable acceptance criteria.
* **Boundary tests exist for every threshold with > or >=**:
  * exactly at threshold should behave correctly (0.90 vs 0.9001)
* **Cooldown windows tested** (e.g., no exit at 119s, exit allowed at >=120s).
* **Where contract names tests**, plan either lists the exact name or says "wrapper alias required."

**Fail if**: a gate is defined but not tied to a test.

### 3) "Must Not Leak" Reason-Code Hygiene (common silent failure)
* Plan explicitly states: **F1_CERT and EvidenceChain failures MUST NOT appear in open_permission_reason_codes**; they belong in `mode_reasons`.
* Plan includes a **test asserting this exclusion**.
* **Reason-code lists are deterministic order** (stable output) to prevent flaky diffs and debugging confusion.

**Fail if**: plan describes the rule but no test exists.

### 4) Artifact & Path Canon (auditability buffer)
For each required artifact class (F1_CERT, TruthCapsule, DecisionSnapshot, reviews, incidents):
* **Exact file paths match contract canonical paths**.
* **Schema keys listed** (at least required keys).
* **Write timing stated relative to dispatch** (e.g., "write BEFORE dispatch").
* **Failure effect stated** (writer failure => EvidenceChainState RED => blocks opens).
* **A test exists that validates the artifact exists and includes keys**.

**Fail if**: plan uses alternative paths without explicitly stating contract-canonical artifacts also exist.

### 5) Time & Freshness Semantics (second-most common ambiguity)
* Every "stale" concept defines:
  * timestamp field name (`*_ts_ms`)
  * freshness window in seconds
  * staleness formula (`now_ms - ts_ms > window_ms`)
* **Poll intervals are explicit** (fee model: 5 min; rate limits: 60s; etc.)
* **"Repeated inability" is quantified** (e.g., 3 consecutive polls fail => Degraded) + test exists.

**Fail if**: plan says "periodically" / "often" / "repeated" without numbers.

### 6) Kill Semantics Hardening (catastrophic-risk gate)
* **Disk Kill**: containment forbidden, no dispatch.
* **Kill containment eligibility predicates are fully enumerated** in one place and referenced everywhere (no "only if eligible" hand-wave).
* **Micro-loop bounds are explicit** (max attempts + max time).
* **Tests cover**:
  * eligible containment permitted
  * ineligible containment forbidden
  * disk kill forbids containment unconditionally

**Fail if**: Kill rules are scattered across sections or missing predicates.

### 7) Rollout/Promotion Governance (don't sabotage the constraint)
* **Canary stage durations match contract ranges** (no legacy schedule lines).
* **Abort triggers are listed** and wired to rollback + cooldown.
* **Replay gate and review artifacts are explicit gates** to promotion.
* **No "shortcut" to Full exists**.

**Fail if**: plan defines a canary schedule inconsistent with contract, even if an "override" exists elsewhere.

### 8) Plan Extras Risk Scan (keep strategy from contaminating safety)
* Any extra work not required by contract is labeled:
  * **SAFE_EXTRA** (tooling/observability/refactor)
  * **RISKY_EXTRA** (introduces bypass, new behavior path, changes gate semantics)
* **RISKY_EXTRAs must include**:
  * explicit "cannot weaken gates" statement
  * feature flag defaults fail-closed
  * tests proving no bypass

**Fail if**: extras touch dispatch, gate ordering, or thresholds without explicit safety proofs.

### 9) TOC Enforcement Rule (your PR workflow)
Before merging strategy logic changes:
1. **Spec-lint passed with 0 FAIL**.
2. **All safety gates have**: definition + effect + precedence + tests.
3. **Only then are strategy changes allowed**.

**Fail if**: a PR changes strategy while any safety lint FAIL exists.
