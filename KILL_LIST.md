# KILL_LIST.md — Top 10 Delete/Merge Candidates

Generated: 2026-01-27

---

## Scoring Rubric Applied

Each candidate scored 0-5 on:
- **Operational criticality** (breaks CI/runtime if wrong)
- **Spec criticality** (normative truth source)
- **Wiring centrality** (how many callers)
- **Drift risk** (duplicate truth? likely to diverge?)
- **Maintenance cost** (complexity, churn)

**Decision rule:** DELETE if no wiring + no unique purpose + safe-delete proof exists

---

## Top 10 Kill Candidates

### 1. `to-do/CONTRACT_patched_*.md` + `to-do/*.diff`
| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operational | 0 |
| Spec | 0 (superseded) |
| Wiring | 0 |
| Drift risk | 5 (stale copy of CONTRACT) |
| Maintenance | 3 (confusing) |

**Evidence:** These are WIP patches that have been incorporated into `specs/CONTRACT.md`
```
to-do/CONTRACT_patched_with_CSP_appendix_CSP_ONLY_metaATs_with_CSP_mapping_preflight_fixes.md:1:
"This is the canonical contract path. Do not edit other copies."
# Contradicts being in to-do/
```

**Safe delete proof:**
```bash
rm -rf to-do/*.md to-do/*.diff
./plans/verify.sh full  # Must pass
```

**Verdict:** **DELETE**

---

### 2. `patches/*.patch` (12 files)
| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operational | 0 |
| Spec | 0 (applied) |

| Maintenance | 2 |

**Evidence:**
```bash
grep -r "patches/" --include="*.sh" . | wc -l
# 0 references from scripts
```

**Safe delete proof:**
```bash

**Evidence:**
```bash
wc -l docs/bundle_CONTRACT_PHASE1.md specs/CONTRACT.md
#  688 docs/bundle_CONTRACT_PHASE1.md
# 5895 specs/CONTRACT.md
